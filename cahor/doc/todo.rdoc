3. Admin dashboard : Admin can create affiliates for a given user.
4. If you receive an INVALID response, then either youâ€™ve done something wrong or the original IPN should be treated as suspicious and investigated.
5. openssl passwd -1 12345 is generating different shadow compatible password on every run.
