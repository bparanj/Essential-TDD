Planning for failure
Failure is inevitable as you disrupt yourself.

There's dignity in suffering, nobility in pain, but failure
is a salted wound that burns and burns again.
According to psychologist Dr. Bren√© Brown, failure is especially
acute for athletes, the military, and for corporate professionals.
When the ethos is, kill or
be killed control or be controlled, failure is being killed.
And it elicits tremendous shame.
It breeds questions like, how could I claim to be a
savvy investor when I backed a business that went belly up?
Daring to disrupt is daring to fail.
And what we can learn from failure is essential to innovation.
reframe this.
The next time you fail, say to yourself, I dare to fail.
I dare to disrupt.
And instead of making this a referendum on you, think, what
can I learn from this failure that is essential to innovation?
