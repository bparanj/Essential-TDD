As you navigate disruption, think about how you can embrace and even
create constraints. 

Constraints, can also lead to faster feedback.
Skateboarders are some of the quickest learners
on the planet.
Every action, every move has an immediate consequence.
For disruptors, constraints aren't a check on absolute freedom.
They're a tool of creation.
Think about, what are my constraints?

Is it time?
Is it money? 
Is it space?
Is it expertise? 

We all have constraints.

But now we think about how that constraint, together
with your distinctive strengths, can become a tool of creation.
