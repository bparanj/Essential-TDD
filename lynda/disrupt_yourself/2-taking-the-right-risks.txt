As you begin to disrupt yourself, think about taking the right risks. People don't buy products, they hire them to fill needs.
Disruptors look for needs not being met, and then try
something new rather than competing against established curves of learning.

The financing of start-ups, for example.
Venture capitalists are raising ever larger
funds precluding them from smaller deals.
This is opening the door for disruption from
smaller pools of capital like angels, accelerators, crowdfunding.

When I moved into equity research, I was
hired to cover the cement and construction center.
I'd started to build my models when Smith
Barney announced it would emerge with Saulman brothers.
And guess what?
They already had a highly ranked cement
and construction analyst, shut the front door.
The side and the back doors are closed.
But, there were a number of media
companies going public, no analysts to cover them.
As the theory of disruption would dictate, I built my
own door and within a year, I was a ranked analyst.
It's natural to think about what our competitors are doing.

Disruptors look at what they're not doing.
So as you're trying to disrupt yourself and
take the right risks, instead of seeing closed doors,
think about how you can build your own door.
