The next step is actually somewhat counter-intuitive.
It's step back or sideways in order to grow.
When a company gets too big, it often stops embracing smaller opportunities.
Revenue just isn't big enough.
Just as Borders with slow to embrace e-commerce, people
can stall at the top of their learning curve.
The way to avoid this?
Jump to a new curve.
This doesn't necessarily mean you need to leave your current company.
Dave Blakely, for example, started his career
as an engineer at IDEO, an innovation consultancy.
He could've worked his way up to manage technical
staff, but early on he volunteered to become a
project manager, which many of his peers dismissed as
an escape route from the rigor and detail of engineering.
Both this backward move allow Blakely to
broaden his skills set, and to begin to climb a new
ladder, and today he is the head of technology strategy at IDEO.
Sometimes sideways or backward turns into a slingshot.
As we're just disrupting yourself, think about do I need
to go sideways, do I need to go backwards, in order to propel myself forward?
How will you know if that's in fact what you're doing?
Well, often times in that backward
move, the people around you, especially the ones who love you,
may say to you, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Well you do know what you're doing,
because you know that according to the principles,
the theory of disruptive innovation, sometimes you have
to step back in order to move forward.
