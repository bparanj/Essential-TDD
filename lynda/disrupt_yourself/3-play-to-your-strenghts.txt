Now that you are taking the right risks.
Play to your distinctive strengths.
Skype came on the market and rather than skirmish with
Verizon for the large corporate customers who required superior sound quality.
Skype went after the people who needed long distance but couldn't afford it.
College students.
For these customers, inferior sound quality was a
small price to pay for Skype's distinctive strength,
it was free.

Whatever your discipline, get the skills
that you need to do your job, and then focus on your distinctive strengths.
If the market doesn't recognize or value that skillset initially.
Even better. That's your competitive edge.
Now you may be wondering, well what are my distinctive strengths?
I'll give you two hints.
Number one, what is something that someone says to you frequently
that you do very, very well, and you fact dismiss them?
It's so easy for you,
it doesn't even occur to you that this is your strength.
That's one of your distinctive strengths.
Number two, what makes you feel powerful?
As you think about the end of a day, what have you
done that you just felt good doing and you wanted to do it?
Again, that's your distinctive strength. So, as you're looking to disrupt yourself.
Think about what makes you feel powerful, and what is something
that people frequently say to you, wow, you do that well.
