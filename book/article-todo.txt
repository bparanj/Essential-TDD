** Localized **

We change only one specific location in our existing code base to implement a new feature.


4. Article 46 link back to article 10 for contract tests.

5. sum example notes:

Link Article 32 to Article 45. Let's look at a different way to solve the same problem. Gauss solving the problem. Recognize the pattern.
