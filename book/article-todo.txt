2. Article 7 : Insert the simplified version of the Red, Green, Refactor diagram.
3. Article 9 should link to a discussion on the most desirable kind of changes to code: configuration driven, additive, localized. Find the scanned notes on this laptop to create that article.

When you implement a new feature we aim to achieve a design in the following order:

** Additive **

This is the most desirable option. We add new code without modifying the existing code.

** Localized **

We change only one specific location in our existing code base to implement a new feature.

Find the scanned notes that covers the above topic and write an article.

Do we test methods?


SUBMIT A PULL REQUEST

When the generator is run, the lib/tasks/resque_tasks.rake looks like this:
 
require 'resque/tasks'
 
The following line is missing for Rails 4.1. I had to manually add it to
the generated rake task to get resque working.
 
```ruby
task 'resque:setup' => :environment
```
Maybe the generator can be changed for Rails 4.1?
