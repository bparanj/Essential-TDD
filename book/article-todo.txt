1. Scan Red, Green, Refactor diagram.
2. Article 7 : Insert the simplified version of the Red, Green, Refactor diagram.
3. Article 9 should link to a discussion on the most desirable kind of changes to code: configuration driven, additive, localized. Find the scanned notes on this laptop to create that article.

When you implement a new feature we aim to achieve a design in the following order:

** Additive **

This is the most desirable option. We add new code without modifying the existing code.

** Localized **

We change only one specific location in our existing code base to implement a new feature.

Find the scanned notes that covers the above topic and write an article.

4. In article 31, explain spiking and how it fits with TDD.

Transformation and Refactoring are the two sides of the same coin. Red to Green is transformation. Green to Green is refactoring.

Refactoring is changing the structure without changing the behavior.
Transformation is changing the behavior with the least change in the structure. This forces us to write minimal code to pass the current test.
