SUBMIT A PULL REQUEST
--------------------------------------------------
When the generator is run, the lib/tasks/resque_tasks.rake looks like this:
 
require 'resque/tasks'
 
The following line is missing for Rails 4.1. I had to manually add it to
the generated rake task to get resque working.
 
```ruby
task 'resque:setup' => :environment
```
Maybe the generator can be changed for Rails 4.1?

Change the code that checks for Rails version 4.1 and if so add the additional line for the rake task.
