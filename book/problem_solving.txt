Solving Programming Problems
----------------------------------------

1. Write down your question.
       This makes you think and clarify your thoughts.
2. Design an experiment to answer that question.
       Keep the variables to a minimum so that you can solve the problem easily.
3. Run the experiment to learn.

Scientists test their hypothesis by designing and running experiments to prove or disprove a hypothesis.
