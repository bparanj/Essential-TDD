Hi ,

I want to achieve an intermediate level of proficiency in CSS3. 

1. What IDE do you recommend? What do you think about Webstorm?
2. What videos do you recommend for beginners to CSS? Is your training videos targeted for beginners?
3. What resources do you recommend?

I would like to meet once a week for one-on-one coaching for 1 to 2 hours. I am willing to pay for your time.

Thanks,
Bala

Hi,

Has anyone installed Ubuntu on 11 inch MacBook Air successfully? I am thinking about buying it without any options. I am also willing to pay if you can help me install it. Please contact me directly if you can help.
