Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art

 Understand the requirements. Determine the scope of the problem.


    Take a good look at the requirements you have.
    Make assumptions to fill in the gaps based on your best guess of what they want
    Write down all your assumptions
    Make them sit down, read, and agree to your assumptions (or, if you're lucky, get them to give in and give you real requirements).
    Now you have detailed requirements that you can estimate from.
