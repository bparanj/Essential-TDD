Prime Factors

Problem Statement
========
---------

Factorize a positive integer number into its prime factors.

Examples
========
---------

Here is some sample input and output.

2 ----> [2]
3 ----> [3]
4 ----> [2,2]
6 ----> [2,3]
9 ----> [3,3]
12 ----> [2,2,3]
15 ----> [3,5]


Steps
========
---------

Step 1
---------

```ruby
describe PrimeFactor do
  it 'should return 2 for input of 2' do
    prime_factorial = PrimeFactor.new(2)
    
    prime = prime_factorial.calculate
    
    expect(prime).to eq([2])
  end
end
```

```ruby
class PrimeFactor
  def initialize(n)
    @n = n
  end
  
  def calculate

  end
end
```

It fails for the right reason.

Step 2
---------

```ruby
class PrimeFactor
  def initialize(n)
    @n = n
  end
  
  def calculate
    [2]
  end
end
```

The test passes.

Step 3
---------

```ruby
class PrimeFactor
  def initialize(n)
    @n = n
  end
  
  def calculate
    [2]
  end
end
```

It fails.

Step 4
---------
  def calculate
    [@n]
  end

Both tests pass.

Step 5
---------

```ruby
  it 'should return [2,2] for input of 4' do
    prime_factorial = PrimeFactor.new(4)

    prime = prime_factorial.calculate

    expect(prime).to eq([2,2])
  end
```

This test fails.

Step 6
---------

Add the following quick and dirty implementation.

```ruby
  def calculate
    result = []
    
    remainder = @n / 2
    result << 2
    result << remainder if Prime.prime?(remainder)
    
    result
  end
```

This test now passes. But it breaks the second spec. We will make it pending for now.

Step 7
---------

Here is some notes from [Prime Factor](http://www.mathsisfun.com/prime-factorization.html "Prime Factor") discussion:

```sh
n = 12
12 / 2 = 6
```

Is 12 evenly divisible by 2? Yes. Add 2 to the result list.

The remainder 6 is not a prime number, so we need to continue processing. Try 2 again:

```sh
6 / 2 = 3
```

6 is evenly divisible by 2, so add 2 to the result list. Is the remainder 3 a prime? Yes. Add it to the result list and STOP. Using this as the reference, here is the implementation that passes the test:

```ruby
  def calculate
    result = []
    
    until Prime.prime?(@n)
      if (@n % 2) == 0
        result << 2
        @n = @n / 2
      end
    end
    result << @n
        
    result
  end
```

From the notes, we have found the terminating condition for our algorithm. We are also using the concept of reduction we learned in an earlier article.

Step 8
---------

Uncomment the second test. This test passes without making any changes because our code is generic enough to handle the edge case of one element.
