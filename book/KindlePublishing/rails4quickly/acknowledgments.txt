This book is the result of teaching Rails tutorials from Silicon Valley Ruby meetup. The members of Silicon Valley Ruby meetup provided me early feedback on every chapter. This book is also an experimentation on applying Lean Startup principles to self publishing.

I owe a debt to the Ruby creator Matz for creating such a beautiful language and the Ruby community for creating useful frameworks and gems to make developers life easy. I hope this book makes your learning process a little easy.
