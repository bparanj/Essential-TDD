Bala Paranj:Hi
  Bala Paranj:Hi Joe
  sl:hi
  Tom:Balal, hi.
  sl:Hi Tom
  Tom:Hi sl
  sl:Hi Bala
  Tom:BTW, what does sl stand for?
  Tom:Is Balal around?
  sl:oops it stanbds fo Al
  sl:I dont see bala  I cant type
  Bala Paranj:Hi Tom
  Bala Paranj:Hi sl
  Bala Paranj:I have been waiting since 1 pm.
  sl:I got distracted
  Bala Paranj:Hi Al
  sl:sirry
  Bala Paranj:Tom, are you still there.
  Bala Paranj:Al, how is it going?
  Bala Paranj:Are you able to follow the instructions in the book.
  Bala Paranj:Let me send you the latest version of the book.
  Tom:Hi, thanks for being here and having the class.  I wonder if the folks on the waiting list don't understand they could easily join?
  Bala Paranj:I know.
  Bala Paranj:For now, this is a limited release.
  Bala Paranj:I will open the class upto 10 people.
  Bala Paranj:But it will be a paid class.
  Bala Paranj:What I realized is this:
  Bala Paranj:There are very few developers who are proactive and learn on their own.
  Bala Paranj:Most of them, want to consume the content in a passive way.
  Bala Paranj:So, I have to provide them the content in a different way.
  Bala Paranj:Probably, 10 minute presentation
  Bala Paranj:Then some guided exercises
  Bala Paranj:Then answering Q&A
  Bala Paranj:Everyone progresses at their own pace.
  Tom:I see there are 2 files, one called "rails.pdf" , the other called "rails_1100468003.pdf".  Are they the same?
  Bala Paranj:Both are same
  Bala Paranj:I uploaded the other file last week
  Bala Paranj:This is the final version.
  Bala Paranj:Only appendix will change
  Bala Paranj:I will include some trouble shooting tips.
  Tom:You are right about the "proactive" part. It's so easy to be distracted at home.
  Tom:I'm downloading "rails.pdf"
  Bala Paranj:Tom, you are in the top 2% of the developers who want to improved their skills by being proactive.
  Bala Paranj:In my face-to-face tutorial class only 2% of the people actually complete the entire blog application tutorial found in 'Getting Started Rails Guide'
  Bala Paranj:Only by investing time on developing our skills on a daily basis we will create better opportunities for ourselves.
  Bala Paranj:I am also motivated by moving towards the 10,000 hours of practice to master programming skills.
  Tom:I wish I were more proactive. I went to a class last night about Phonegap. There's a new software called Monaca to develop apps for phones.
  Tom:Monaca is a Japanese software and 2 or 3 guys from Tokyo were there.
  Bala Paranj:I read the Scott Adams book. He says more skills you have, better your chance of getting lucky and succeeding.
  Tom:I was hoping to talk to them today b/c I wasn't able to do everything last night.
  Bala Paranj:You are doing the right thing by learning new skills, web development, mobile etc.
  Tom:They are using the offices of Rackspace at 620 Folsom.
  Bala Paranj:He says, it is the combination of different skills that makes you a big success
  Tom:Tonight I will go to the weekly Scala class - we just sit there and watch the Coursera weeky videos. Scala is very deep, has something called a "future" function to get a future value of a variable or function.
  Bala Paranj:How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big
  Bala Paranj:Good book.
  Bala Paranj:Is it a functional language?
  Tom:I will look for that book.
  Tom:I guess so, the last or current class was called functional programming in Scala. Walmart has gone from Java to Scala
  Bala Paranj:As a developer I never thought I need to learn about Persuasion, Business Writing and other things he recommends
  Bala Paranj:He recommends certain topics
  Tom:The weekly Scala class is in Meetup.com, held at Stumble Upon on Brannan and 2nd.
  Bala Paranj:Big data seems to be here to stay
  Bala Paranj:Definitely, it's good to get good at one of the top languages for that purpose.
  Tom:Attending meetups is one thing, but studying at home is very very difrficult.
  Bala Paranj:Distractions?
  Bala Paranj:I like quiet places like the library for studying.
  Tom:Yes, distractions (the Internet) and motivation. I know some go to the library.
  Tom:Personal safety is an issue with me in SF and even at my apartment
  Bala Paranj:Were you able to setup everything for your development envronment?
  Bala Paranj:That's unfortunate.
  Tom:Have started over with Vagrant. uninstalled what I had, reinstalled vagrant. That's about it for now.  Need to work with your book and see if I can use Vagrant with Ruby/Rails
  Bala Paranj:Ok
  Tom:Last Friday and Saturday, I went to a Railsbridge.  Was there all day Saturday, very very good. Teacher was Caleb Clausen.  He works at Trucar.
  Bala Paranj:I hear great things about Railsbridge.
  Bala Paranj:I need to attend and learn from those guys too.
  Tom:Yes, the Railsbridge ionline documentation is very good.  I'll get the website.
  Bala Paranj:I stole their structure for my book.
  Bala Paranj:Making complex things simple is not easy.
  sl:still having trouble w env  upgraded to ruby 2.0.0 today to use latest rails  now have issues w eclipse  bug
  Bala Paranj:Sl, why don't you try Sublime?
  Bala Paranj:Sublime Text 2
  Tom:http://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/
  Bala Paranj:Sl, are you on PC ?
  Bala Paranj:That's a great resource Tom. I know about their site.
  Bala Paranj:Have you used codeacademy.com ?
  Tom:Railsbridge uses Sublime Text 2;  in the past they used Komodo.  
  Tom:I was taking the CodeCademy course on Javascript, but havenk't been doing that lately.
  Tom:Is there a community (fee) version of Rubymine?
  Tom:I'll find out.
  Bala Paranj:I know they have a free trial for month I think.
  Bala Paranj:They came out with RubyMine 6.0 few days ago.
  Bala Paranj:Do you think codeacademy guys did a good job in teaching the javascript concepts?
  Tom:Yeah, it looks like only free for 30 days..
  Bala Paranj:RubyMine is the best.
  Bala Paranj:I would buy it.
  Bala Paranj:It's a good investment.
  Bala Paranj:Also, East Bay Ruby meetup gives out one license per month.
  Tom:Codecademy, yes. Some frustration with the interactive: your code may be correct, but still get an error message. Maybe they've improved over the past year.
  Bala Paranj:I tried them few weeks ago. It seems to be well designed and the lessons have good structure.
  Tom:Hi r
  Bala Paranj:They are also funded. Since it's free, it's very popular.
  Bala Paranj:Hi r
  Tom:I know someone who says he completed both the Javascri;t and the PHP at Codecademy
  Bala Paranj:It would be nice, if we know the name of the person joining us.
  r:Hi, how is everybody doing.  My name is Randy
  Bala Paranj:So he is now confident he can learn more on his own?
  Bala Paranj:Hi Randy
  Bala Paranj:Good to see you
  Bala Paranj:Please download the rails.pdf from here
  Bala Paranj:This is the latest version.
  Bala Paranj:I think codeacademy does a good job for people who are new to programming.
  Bala Paranj:They can start learning without getting caught up with installation issues
  Tom:I think he feels that way, but I don't see him anymore - he changed jobs and isn't where I used to see him.k
  Bala Paranj:Tom, are you a web developer?
  Tom:Not yet.
  Bala Paranj:You work primarily in the back-end?
  Tom:I started out programming in Folrtran at a lab, became a systems programmer, then later did Cobol programming, then went into a different field. Am now learning as much as possible about popular software systems.  Need to focus. I guess Java/Scala is for big banks, insurance companies, other places too (Dolby Sound for one), while Ruby/Rails is for web development with fast progress in development..
  Bala Paranj:You probably have 10,000 hours in programming by now
  Bala Paranj:But 10,000 hours of deliberate practice is different work experience
  Tom:Yes.  There are still jobs listed for Fortran programmers at Indeed.com
  Tom:I guess I should work on your book at this point, try to use Vagrant to develop your project in the book
  Bala Paranj:Ok. I will be quiet.
  Tom:Not what I meant.  I mean in the next few days.  
  Bala Paranj:Are you joining me on Dec 3rd session?
  Tom:That's next Tuesday, yes.
  Bala Paranj:Great
  Bala Paranj:I think you will be able to finish it by working now on dec 3rd.
  Bala Paranj:All classes after Dec 3rd will be paid ones.
  Bala Paranj:You are welcome to attend any of the online class as my guest.
  Tom:Thanks!!! Much appreciated.
  Bala Paranj:No problem. Thanks for being the early adopter and helping me overcome the technical difficulties with Adobe Connect.
  Bala Paranj:That is the least I can do.
  Bala Paranj:You know, I found out the reason for the small size of Textmate.
  Tom:This is the phonegap development webiste from last night. http://blog.asial.co.jp/1144?lang=en   I haven't been able to get too far with it.
  Bala Paranj:I saw my notes and realized that I need to change the resolution for screen sharing.
  Bala Paranj:Getting far is not the point.
  Bala Paranj:You are pushing yourself.
  Bala Paranj:That's more important.
  Bala Paranj:If don't fail, you will never grow
  Tom:You are a good teacher.
  Bala Paranj:Seems to just html and CSS
  Bala Paranj:Thank you Tom.
  Bala Paranj:I learn about teaching too.
  Bala Paranj:Patrick Winston's videos
  Bala Paranj:Lynda.com classes on Flipping Classroom etc.
  Tom:Somehow at that phonegap development site, you can launch a virtual phone so u can see the result of ur code.
  Bala Paranj:Have you read the 'Lean Startup' book.
  Bala Paranj:Wow
  Tom:Glad to have the book references. will follow-up. Am using the SF library lately.
  Tom:Peninsula libraries probably better, not so many homeless.
  Bala Paranj:I customized the 'Build Measure Learn' loop he mentions in his book.
  Bala Paranj:In my case it is 'Learn Develop Teach' loop.
  Bala Paranj:I enjoy all the three phases.
  Tom:Marakana used to teach courses to corporate clients. Then they went in-house at Twitter. New company is called New Circle.. They still host all the videos from Marakana days.
  Bala Paranj:Twitter bought Marakana?
  Tom:https://thenewcircle.com/
  Tom:Something like that.  The brothers are at Twitter full time. Will get their names
  Bala Paranj:Have you taken Marakana classes?
  Tom:No, no, way way too expensive.
  Tom:For wealthy corporate clients who can  pay $2,500 for a 3-day course.
  Bala Paranj:Is it taught be professional developers?
  Tom:But Marakana used to run some meetup groups (same guys still do):  Java, Android, HTML5, etc. and they would post videos of the meetups.
  Bala Paranj:I see lot of companies having trainers who are not real world developers
  Bala Paranj:They don't understand developers, so the teaching is very poor
  Tom:The Gargenta brothers, Aleksander Gargenta and Marko Gargenta
  Bala Paranj:That's the New Circle team?
  Tom:As I understand it, the Aleksander and Marko Gargenta are both now in-house at Twitter. At The New Circle are some prior staff of Marakana, and probably some new people. DOn't know if the Gargenta brothers also own New Circle.  I would think so.
  Bala Paranj:All educational companies are getting bought by big companies
  Bala Paranj:Peepcode is gone
  Tom:What was Peepcode?
  Bala Paranj:Probably Pluralsight has an earn-out deal with Peepcode
  Bala Paranj:Geof Groshenbach
  Bala Paranj:peepcode.com
  Bala Paranj:tekpub.com is also gone
  Tom:I just went to https://peepcode.com/ Never heard of it before.  Thanks.
  Tom:Tech training is a growing field, big money.
  Bala Paranj:They created video training for ruby 
  Bala Paranj:Ya
  Bala Paranj:It's a multi-billion dollar industry
  Bala Paranj:railscasts.com is not inactive
  Bala Paranj:I mean inactive
  Tom:I think tech trainers in SF at law firms make 5 figure salaries.
  Tom:Make that 6-figure
  Bala Paranj:As a developer it is overwhelming to learn so many things
  Bala Paranj:I think that is a problem for developers who want to learn.
  Tom:http://railscasts.com/
  Bala Paranj:Too much information
  Bala Paranj:Yes.
  Bala Paranj:That's right.
  Bala Paranj:He come up with content on a consistent basis.
  Bala Paranj:Now he has become inactive for the past 3 months.
  Bala Paranj:Burnout, he says/.
  Tom:Yes, must learn so much, then constantly changing, upgrading, new versions as well.
  Bala Paranj:Don't you think that front-end technologies change must faster?
  Tom:Javascript, Phonegap, Ruby/Rails, etc. have more changes than the databases
  Bala Paranj:Things like Unix, SQL are stable.
  Tom:Always new frameworks being announced
  Bala Paranj:That's a problem.
  Bala Paranj:Too many frameworks
  Bala Paranj:It's not possible to master all of them.
  Bala Paranj:We could use Google Trends and only learn the best frameworks.
  Tom:There's a lot of turnover in jobs, no?
  Tom:companies must spend money on re-training employees.
  Bala Paranj:In high-tech, yes.
  Bala Paranj:These days, companies don't spend money on training or re-training.
  Tom:Or else companaies just dump the old employee and hire the new one who was recently trained.
  Bala Paranj:That's true.
  Bala Paranj:You can cry about discrimination as much as you want.
  Bala Paranj:Reality is companies do discriminate
  Bala Paranj:We as professional developers should take charge of our careers
  Tom:They discriminate on basis of who has the latest training, or other things.
  Bala Paranj:Why pay 3 times the salary of a new graduate?
  Bala Paranj:They can train the new graduate instead of experienced developers.
  Bala Paranj:Good ROI.
  Bala Paranj:Just Math
  Bala Paranj:Nothing personal.
  Tom:They prefer younger employees.
  Bala Paranj:We also need to think in terms of ROI.
  Bala Paranj:Where can I spend the least amount of time and learn the most valuable skills for the job market?
  Tom:I keep a list of training sources. codecademy, w3 schools, etc.  But classroom, face-to-face is best.
  Bala Paranj:I agree.
  Bala Paranj:The interaction with others and the teacher definitely helps in learning.
  Tom:Yes, both input from other students and the teacher.
  Bala Paranj:You learn as much from other developers as you learn from the instructor.
  Tom:Yes, even the insults sometimes.
  Bala Paranj:ha ha
  Tom:But that's negative, you develop relations with other students, and they have comments during class that illustrate difficult concepts.
  Bala Paranj:Questions definitely zoom in on difficult concepts.
  Bala Paranj:The challenge as an instructor is that developers have diverse backgrounds and are at different stages in their learning curve.
  Tom:It's great you have written a Ruby/Rails book
  Tom:At the Railsbridge Saturday, we used Git routines to push a project to Heroku.  Heroku and Github must be similar. Wonder if Heroku doesn't have some routines to do the pushing.
  Tom:It's nearly 3PM.  Shall we keep going?
  Bala Paranj:I will be here till 3:30 pm.
  Tom:Thanks. I need to run some errands and get to this evening's meetup.  Guess Ii'd better get going for now.
  Bala Paranj:Ok. See you on Dec 3rd then?
  Tom:My apartment is freezing - I don't run a heater!!
  Bala Paranj:Please send me feedback about the book.
  Tom:Yes, Dec. 3.  See you then or by email sooner.
  Bala Paranj:Have a good day!
  Bala Paranj:Bye.
  Tom:I will send feedback.  thanks for asking.  It will motivate me some more.  See you on the 3rd.
  Tom:Bye.
  Tom:Have a good day, too.
  Tom:By sl and r
  Tom:That is, bye sl and r.
  Tom:I tried to capture the chat for my notes, but it is a small buffer.  I got most of it but missing some at the top.  Maybe buffer size can be increased.
  sl:me too
  Al:log out and log in again - you will see COMPLETE transcript - you can copy ALL - must be a bug
  Tom:Al, Thanks for the tip!  I did log out and log back in , and have the COMPLETE transcript.  Excellent.
  Brad:anyone here?
  Bala Paranj:Hi Brad
  Brad:hello Bala
  Bala Paranj:Did you download the file I have uploaded here?
  Brad:yes, and I finished it last night, I dont really have any questions about it, it was very easy
  Bala Paranj:Great
  Bala Paranj:Did you already have a background in other web application frameworks?
  Brad:no I dont, Ive been trying to learn Rails for a long time, I did the Hartl tutorial, but I still cant figure out how to make web apps on my own
  Bala Paranj:What's holding you back?
  Brad:Its just too complicated, I sort of understand how everything works, but I cant seem to make anything on my own. maybe it is too easy, with scaffolding you can make a fully functioning twitter app in about 3 lines of console entrie
  Brad:hi Al
  Bala Paranj:Hi Al
  Bala Paranj:Please download the file if you haven't done so already.
  Bala Paranj:It is the latest version
  Bala Paranj:Brad, have you developed a paper prototype first?
  Bala Paranj:If you break down the big problems into very small problems, then you can solve one small problem at a time
  Brad:no, I cant seem to think beyond the twitter app layout, I guess thats why its hard, its too easy
  Bala Paranj:Looks like you are overwhelmed  with learning too many things at once.
  Brad:yes, honestly I dont know how to go beyond where I am at now, I guess I should just hang out here and watch you help other people
  Al:Hi Brad and Bala
  Bala Paranj:Brad, have you worked through the Depot app in Agile Web Development book?
  Brad:hi Al
  Bala Paranj:I can tell you what I did to learn Rails.
  Bala Paranj:I worked through a expense report application I found on Apple's site.
  Brad:Bala, no havent, I was so discouraged after completing the Hartl book and knowing nothing that I stopped there
  Bala Paranj:That's a good start.
  Bala Paranj:Allocate 30 mins to an hour everyday and work through the Depot app.
  Bala Paranj:You have to practice.
  Bala Paranj:That's what I did.
  Bala Paranj:I have worked through the Depot app several times
  Brad:ok, I will get that book
  Bala Paranj:Practice now.
  Brad:is the rails file with the numbers your updated version of your tutorial?
  Bala Paranj:Just watching videos will not help you.
  Bala Paranj:Yes.
  Bala Paranj:If you have questions with Depot app, you are welcome to post it here.
  Brad:ok, I guess I will have to wait till next time to go over that with you
  Bala Paranj:No problem.
  Brad:Al- have you done Bala's Rails book?
  Bala Paranj:One thing that made it easy for me to learn is I started with Rails 1.1 version.
  Bala Paranj:It was very easy.
  Bala Paranj:Because there was not that many things to learn at once.
  Al:I did some of it
  Bala Paranj:I already had web app experience building apps in Java Struts framework.
  Bala Paranj:Right now, Rails 4 adds lot of things to a beginners learning curve
  Bala Paranj:Which is definitely an overload issue
  Brad:do you think that using generate is bad (I dont even know if that is part of scaffolding)
  Bala Paranj:Al, you can also just use pragmatic programmers book as a reference
  Bala Paranj:If you already have an app you want to work on for your business
  Bala Paranj:Hi Rmona
  Bala Paranj:Good to see you again
  Bala Paranj:I really appreacite your honest feedback.
  Ramona:Hi - sorry I'm late. We were putting all our little fruit trees inside before my husband left .
  Bala Paranj:It helped me to revise the book
  Bala Paranj:No problem.
  Ramona:Oh, I'm glad. I will need your red pen on my code I'll bet :-)
  Bala Paranj:What is a good next step for you Ramona?
  Bala Paranj:Are you developing your own web apps?
  Bala Paranj:Learning more?
  Ramona:Yes, got the Ubuntu environment set up - that had nearly as many caveats as Windows..
  Bala Paranj:I know that Yehuda raised $50k for his Rails installer for Mac OS
  Ramona:I had to back pedal on versions there because I have several domains at Bluehost and they are on Rails 3.2.13 and Ruby 1.9.3
  Bala Paranj:Have you guys installed it?
  Ramona:Wow
  Bala Paranj:I think it is called Taikeido or something
  Ramona:It must really meet a need
  Ramona:Introduce me to the other attendees?
  Brad:yes, I have Rails 4 installed on my Macbook
  Bala Paranj:What version of Ruby ?
  Bala Paranj:I think so.
  Al:Ramona, what problems with windows? So far Ruby 2.0 was a lot easier than 1.9 to set up on Windows.
  Brad:Ruby 2.0
  Bala Paranj:Besides, Yehuda has a reputation. He will deliver  a useful product.
  Bala Paranj:Brad, are you using RVM?
  Ramona:Yes, I used Ruby 2.0 and Rails 4 plus RubyMine IDE - most of the problems were around the SSH key to deploy to Heroku 
  Brad:yes, I installed RVM, but actually it was because I installed homebrew that uses Ruby that I got the latest version of Ruby installed automatically
  Bala Paranj:Ramona, do you have your own web apps in production?
  Ramona:All resolved now, that site is in the beginning stage of construction at 4sp2013.com - the first one I'm working on in Ubuntu is dadufix4me.com (nothing there yet)
  Bala Paranj:I host on Linode.
  Ramona:Using text editors only on Ubuntu, they run really fast even in a VM
  Bala Paranj:Pay only $20 / mo. I still get lot of juice for that price.
  Ramona:Yes I'd heard of them, and digital ocean
  Bala Paranj:Linode keeps increasing the hardware specs for the same plan, which is great.
  Bala Paranj:I heard about digital ocean because railscasts.com is hosted by them.
  Bala Paranj:Ramona, are still learning Rails or working on getting your app to production?
  Ramona:I'll be looking for a better host for a site I want to build as soon as I get the hang of rails, easyofficeforms.com, which is a collaboration with someone who will design the forms..
  Bala Paranj:Sounds like a great idea
  Brad:Al, if you have any questions about Bala's book, ask away, I finished, so I can help too
  Bala Paranj:If it is view intensive, I would consider using AngularJS instead of Rails
  Bala Paranj:Rails doesn't really shine in the view layer
  Bala Paranj:You could still have your backend in Rails
  Bala Paranj:Thanks Brad.
  Bala Paranj:Ramona also finished it.
  Al:No questions so far, I just got to go through the rest..
  Brad:Bala, does Angular and Rails work well together? I would think that partials would interfere with Angular
  Bala Paranj:She gave me lot of grammatical corrections.
  Ramona:I have a question or two..
  Bala Paranj:Ramona, I also added the answer to your question to the book.
  Bala Paranj:Yes, Brad.
  Ramona:I finished the book and Bala gave me a good explanation of belongs_to (good, it went in the book!)
  Bala Paranj:Brad, you basically use Rails backend as an API that provides the view with JSON.
  Bala Paranj:Very interactive Single Page Apps are a good fit for AngularJS.
  Ramona:I still have questions about model vs. controller - so if I understand correctly the model is a database schema, but the controller is the code that queries the data in the model?
  Bala Paranj:If you learn Angular now, you will be an early adopter. It is still in version 1.0
  Bala Paranj:Think of controller as a traffic cop
  Bala Paranj:It directs incoming requests
  Bala Paranj:It knows which controller can handle the incoming request
  Al:Controller is go-between between Model and View?
  Brad:Ramona- I think the Model is what translates between SQL and Ruby, the Controller does routing
  Bala Paranj:Sorry
  Bala Paranj:Router knows which controller should handle the request
  Bala Paranj:Controller controls the flow of data into the backend repository
  Bala Paranj:And also data flowing from the db back to the view.
  Bala Paranj:Controller knows which models can do the job and it delegates it to the appropriate model
  Bala Paranj:Yes, Al.
  Bala Paranj:Controller knows which view to render next
  Bala Paranj:It basically controls the views and orchestrates the work that is done by the model
  Ramona:Thanks Brad and Bala - then in SQL Server for instance, if I'm joining multiple tables I'll create a bridge table which doesn't serve any purpose except to create relationships - is that similar to 'has_and_belongs_to_many?'
  Bala Paranj:It provides the data required for the views to display them to the user.
  Bala Paranj:controller does not query the db.
  Bala Paranj:Only models will query the db.
  Bala Paranj:model in Rails terminology wise interacts with db
  Brad:Ramona, I think the commands to create relationships in the db are done in the XXXcontroller.rb file
  Bala Paranj:It depends whether you have 1-1, 1-N or N-N relationships
  Ramona:That was my next ? but you already answered
  Ramona:RE the query engine being the model
  Bala Paranj:No Brad. The relationships are defined in the model
  Ramona:But I see Brad's point, why are the belongs_to type phrases in the controller?
  Brad:oh thats right, its the XXX_controller.rb file
  Bala Paranj:Controller will not have any active record declarations in them.
  Bala Paranj:Only models.
  Al:Is the "View" in MVC the same as a "view = virtual table" in SQL?
  Bala Paranj:No Al.
  Ramona:I do hear you
  Brad:I hear you
  Bala Paranj:This View is the HTML, JSON or XML.
  Brad:sorry again, its not the XXX_controller file, its the file in the models folder
  Bala Paranj:It is not related to the database view concept at all.
  Bala Paranj:Ramona, is it clear now?
  Ramona:Yes
  Brad:but in your book you only deal with .erb files, no JSON or XML
  Bala Paranj:Yes.
  Ramona:Has anyone seen a chart on line - like an ORM layout that gives a visual repressentation?
  Bala Paranj:That's a good point.
  Brad:hello Andy
  Andy:hello
  Bala Paranj:I can add another chapter to show you how easy it is to handle JSON, XML etc.
  Bala Paranj:Hi Andy
  Brad:Bala, that would be great
  Ramona:It's very good for the purpose of 'quickly'
  Bala Paranj:Andy, you can download the latest version of Rails from the files section.
  Andy:Doing that now
  Ramona:What is her name or site?
  Brad:the workflow of rails seems easy, you just generate models and controllers and just fill in the .erb files in the view as well as fill in the controller methods in the routes file
  Bala Paranj:http://slash7.com/cheats/activerecord_cheatsheet.pdf
  Brad:yes, but in your book you use the rake file to figure out all the REST
  Ramona:So are you saying more/smaller controllers vs. larger complex ones are easier to maintain in a big app?
  Bala Paranj:Subscription 
  Bala Paranj:I did not discuss in detail the RESTful design
  Bala Paranj:Sweetspot for Rails is the simple to medium sized projects.
  Bala Paranj:Curated set of design patterns.
  Bala Paranj:Amy Hoy
  Brad:Bala- do you rely on generate to generate all your controllers and models, or do you do things by hand sometimes?
  Ramona:Yes, thanks for that link
  Bala Paranj:Hexagonal architecture
  Bala Paranj:Alaistair Coburn come up with this thing, also called as Ports and Adapter.
  Bala Paranj:http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture
  Bala Paranj:Growsing OO system guided by Tests
  Bala Paranj:by Nat Pryce
  Bala Paranj:The use this architecture.
  Bala Paranj:concerns
  Bala Paranj:Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans
  Bala Paranj:Domain Driven Design Quickly
  Bala Paranj:infoq.com
  Bala Paranj:Aggregates
  Bala Paranj:Gateways
  Bala Paranj:Eric talks about Value Objects and other very useful patterns
  Brad:the book just seems very easy, you just run generate commands for controllers and models and just fill in the .erb files and routes function definitions
  Al:Have you heard about DCI architecture? What do you think?
  Brad:thats true, if you miss one tiny step in the Hartl tutorial it will not work and its impossible for a beginner to fix it
  Bala Paranj:http://gitimmersion.com/
  Bala Paranj:I am also planning to add a section in the appendix for troubleshooting
  Ramona:So if you were building an app that had to scale to either SMB or enterprise clients, would Rails be  sufficient?
  Bala Paranj:Tips
  Bala Paranj:Sara Mei
  Ramona:Are some of Rails db connectors more fully developed/ preferable to others? Or is it vendor neutral as to the db back-end?
  Ramona:yes
  Ramona:With SQL Server as the db you tend to tune the db itself by looking at the execution plan and determining if the query could be improved
  Ramona:Yes, and I'm curious whether you can adjust how your query executes in the model?
  Bala Paranj:you can do find_by_sql
  Ramona:In the case of tuning  SQL Server you could then write a stored procedure or view to speed things up and query that directly, is that how it works in Rails?
  Bala Paranj:that will take any arbitrary sql query
  Ramona:That makes sense
  Ramona:yes
  Bala Paranj:Enterprise Rails Recipes
  Bala Paranj:by pragmatic programmers
  Ramona:great, thanks
  Bala Paranj:guides.rails.org
  Brad:I cant figure out how anyone can understand how to generate models and controllers without having everything explained
  Brad:I thought your book was actually better than the Hartl book in explaining how and why models and controller work together
  Ramona:exactly, like breaking down the routing table and providing the proper terms like prefix - that was helpful
  Ramona:The first Ruby presentation I attended a couple months ago was about concurrency and enabling multi-threading
  Ramona:JRuby was suggested and I included it in the 4sp2013 project - does JRuby automate this? Yes
  Ramona:Does it accomplish the multi-threading simply by being included in the project or are more steps involved?
  Brad:I think if you want real concurrency you have to use a multithreading language like Scala or Erlang, even node.js which uses Javascript does concurrency better than Rails
  Ramona:Thanks
  Bala Paranj:You are welcome
  Ramona:So you could use it to mockup larger apps, even if they didn't end up there?
  Brad:OK, I think I'll take off now, thanks for you help Bala, and it was good meeting you Ramona and Al, bye
  Ramona:Thanks for your comments Brad
  Bala Paranj:Bye.
  Bala Paranj:Are you planning to join the next class ?
  Ramona:That makes sense. I'm about to sign off also. It was good to have multiple participants. Yes, I'll attend again.
  Ramona:Thanks for your generosity in providing this training!
  Bala Paranj:Ok. Have a good day.
  Bala Paranj:It's only you and me Al.
  Al:Oh I'll go too.  It's been interesring.  Thanks
  Bala Paranj:Bye.
