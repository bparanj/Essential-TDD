# A. Self Learning #

## Solving Programming Problems ##

1. Write down your question.
       This makes you think and clarify your thoughts.
2. Design an experiment to answer that question.
       Keep the variables to a minimum so that you can solve the problem easily.
3. Run the experiment to learn.

Use the IRB and Rails console to run your experiments.

## Learning from Rails Documentation ##

1. Go to http://apidock.com/rails 
2. Type the method on the search box at the top.
3. Select the matching result
4. View the documentation, look for an example similar to what you want to accomplish
5. Experiment in the Rails console to learn how it works.
6. Copy it to your project and customize it for your project

## Getting Help from Forums ##

If you have followed the above two suggestions and you still have difficulties, post to forums that clearly explains the problem and what you have done to solve the problem on your own. During this process sometimes you will solve your own problem since explaining the problem to someone will clarify your thinking.

## Form Study Group ##

You can accelerate your learning by forming a study group that meets regularly. If you teach one concept that takes 10 minutes then having a group of 6 people, you can easily cover 6 concepts in one hour.

## Practice, Practice, Practice ##

Learning is a process. Setup 30 mins or an hour everyday for learning. Repetition is key to gaining speed in your development.
