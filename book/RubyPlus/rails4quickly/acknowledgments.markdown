# Acknowlegments #

This book is the result of teaching Rails tutorials at the Silicon Valley Ruby meetup. The members of Silicon Valley Ruby meetup provided me early feedback on every chapter. This book is also an experiment in applying 'Lean Startup' principles to self publishing. The advice that was very powerful to me was 'Do not develop a product in a vacuum.'

I owe debts to the creator of Ruby, Matz for creating such a beautiful language; as well as the Ruby community for creating useful frameworks and gems to make a developer's life easy. I hope this book makes your learning process a little easier.
