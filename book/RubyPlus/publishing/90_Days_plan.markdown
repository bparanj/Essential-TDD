# Financial plan #

* 90 days is not sufficient to gain momentum . 2 years is good.
* How can I give myself a two year runway?
		- Take loan from company
		- Take per diem for 10 months

# 	Revenue Plan #

100,000 / year = 1,000 customers x $2 x 24 products
															or
				   	 		 = 1,000 customers x $10 x 10 products

# Bottlenecks #

 - How fast can I create quality content?
 - How much can I charge for each book?
 - How long is the shelf life of the book?

##	Time Constraints ##

1 Signature product. 20 hours / week, 12 weeks time constraint

## Sustainable Pace ##	

 - 12 products in a year.
 - 1 quality product per month. Priced at $10.
 - 1,000 x 10 x 12 = 120,000

# 	Why Full Time Focus on Business ? #

- Spend most productive time to create products
- Speed up development of Essential TDD course.

# End of 90 Days Evaluation #

  - Did I create plans for year 2014?
	- Did I gain clarity?
	- Is there a focus?

## Option 1 ##

  - Find a contract and continue the publishing business part-time

## Option 2 ##

  - Jump into publishing business full-time if the monthly passive income is at least $5000 per month and more books can be written.

	20 books x $5 average price x 1000 customers = $100,000

# 	Trash Can

Minimize taxes for 2014 is not a good reason. Because the invoices for nov and dec will be paid in 2014 for contract. It is applicable for w2 employee. Still it is a scarcity mentality.
