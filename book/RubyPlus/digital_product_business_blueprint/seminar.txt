What is an Infopreneur?

Infopreneur is defined as a person who gathers, organizes and disseminates information as a business venture. It combines the words 'information' and 'entrepreneur'. 

According to the dictionary, Entreprenur is defined as : A person who organizes and operates a business by taking on greater than normal financial risks. 

You don't have to take on greater than normal financial risks. I will show you how to minimize the risk and maximize your chances for success in this course.

Why become an Infopreneur?

Infopreneur sells information product. An information product is information that is packaged in a way that can be sold and delivered over and over again.

Most successful infopreneurs have built businesses arount 'how-to' information. It teaches others how to do something or how to do something efficiently.

There is a lot of demand for 'How-to' knowledge that you have gained through real world experience. You have made costly mistakes to gain valuable experiential knowledge. You can help others avoid the costly mistakes. You can package your 'know-how' and sell them to your customers directly. 

- How to play a piano
- How to develop a real estate
- How to use a word processor
- How to play tennis
- How to coach a basket ball team

The list is only limited by your imagination. Don't think that your knowledge is not valuable. Let the market decide whether they are willing to pay and how much. If done right, you can build a very profitable business.

How do you capture the 'how-to' information?

You can write ebooks using any word processor. You can create audios and videos with inexpensive home equipment and software you can buy at your local electronics store. You create the information product once and then you get paid for that work over and over again; often, for years. 

If you spend 100 hours developing the product. You can sell copies of that product to thousands of people every year for the next 10 years! You get paid for those 100 hours of effort, over and over again. 

You can sell your digital products over the Internet to people all over the world. They can order online with their credit card and get access to a digital version of the product. They can download and read it on their computer or print it out themselves. They can view videos online, in their web browser. 

This process can all happen automatically, without you having to lift a finger. When you're selling digital information products online, you can build a business that runs mostly on auto-pilot and create a passive revenue stream that feeds your bank account while you're free to focus on other things.

Why should they buy when there is free information?

Information overload can overwhelm and confuse people. They become paralyzed, unable to take any action to achieve their goals. They want actionable information. They are eager to learn from other successful people who have been there and done that. It helps them get a better result without the frustrating trial and error approach. They want to acquire skills quickly so that they can apply those skills and make money.

You can filter and package information in an actionable way. Share secrets to your success and help others acquire skills quickly. Paid products have higher quality than free information. 

You can capture all your hard-earned real life knowledge of building and running a successful business in a series of 'how-to' manuals and videos. People who want to start their own part-time business like yours can save themselves a lot of time, money and hassle by buying your products to learn what you've already figured out. 

You can sell information products based on your business development experience. You can create digital information products that teach others how to do the very same thing; in a fraction of the time and without all of the trail and error you had to go through along the way. Your customers save time, money and hassle and they will also achieve higher-quality results.

One of the big mistakes people make is thinking that whatever they know is actually a common knowledge. So they think it's not worth anything. It's human nature. Once you know something, it's easy to assume that everyone else knows it.

This mistaken belief prevents many would-be infopreneurs from even getting started. They might have a million-dollar information business locked-up in their brain, but because they can't understand why someone else would actually value that information and pay for it, they don't even try.

Why would someone buy from you ?

Why would someone pay for what I know? is a great question. Let me ask you : Why do you buy information products? You've probably purchased a 'how-to' product at some point in your life, right? Why did you buy it?

You likely bought it because the information was going to save you time, money or hassle. That's exactly why people would pay good money for what you know.

You've probably spent years gaining your knowledge and experience. Don't you think someone could save themselves a lot of time, money or hassle learning what you already know? Couldn't you help them avoid a lot of costly mistakes? Couldn't you make it easier for them to accomplish whatever they're trying to accomplish? Of course you could.

Are you now ready to learn how to build a profitable Infopreneurial business? Ok. Let's get started.

The essential ingredients of a business are:

- Customer
- Product
- Profit

No profit   --> Non-Profit
No product  --> Scam
No customer --> Bailout (or Facebook)

No one is going to give you a bailout. You are not Mark Suckerberg. We all know where scammers end up. You can start your own non-profit and hug trees after you become rich.

The sequence is important, you have to start with the customer first. You have to find out their needs and pain by talking to them. Then you focus on creating a quality product that your customers are willing to buy that turns a healthy profit for your business. 
 
Do not develop a product and then look for a customer later. This is a receipe for failure.
