What is an Infopreneur?

Infopreneur is defined as a person who gathers, organizes and disseminates information as a business venture. It combines the words 'information' and 'entrepreneur'. 

According to the dictionary, Entreprenur is defined as : A person who organizes and operates a business by taking on greater than normal financial risks. 

You don't have to take on greater than normal financial risks. I will show you how to minimize the risk and maximize your chances for success in this course.

Why become an Infopreneur?

Infopreneur sells information product. An information product is information that is packaged in a way that can be sold and delivered over and over again.

Most successful infopreneurs have built businesses arount 'how-to' information. It teaches others how to do something or how to do something efficiently.

There is a lot of demand for 'How-to' knowledge that you have gained through real world experience. You have made costly mistakes to gain valuable experiential knowledge. You can help others avoid the costly mistakes. You can package your 'know-how' and sell them to your customers directly. 

- How to play a piano
- How to develop a real estate
- How to use a word processor
- How to play tennis
- How to coach a basket ball team

The list is only limited by your imagination. Don't think that your knowledge is not valuable. Let the market decide whether they are willing to pay and how much. If done right, you can build a very profitable business.

How do you capture the 'how-to' information?

You can write ebooks using any word processor. You can create audios and videos with inexpensive home equipment and software you can buy at your local electronics store. You create the information product once and then you get paid for that work over and over again; often, for years. 

If you spend 100 hours developing the product. You can sell copies of that product to thousands of people every year for the next 10 years! You get paid for those 100 hours of effort, over and over again. 

You can sell your digital products over the Internet to people all over the world. They can order online with their credit card and get access to a digital version of the product. They can download and read it on their computer or print it out themselves. They can view videos online, in their web browser. 

This process can all happen automatically, without you having to lift a finger. When you're selling digital information products online, you can build a business that runs mostly on auto-pilot and create a passive revenue stream that feeds your bank account while you're free to focus on other things.

Why should they buy when there is free information?

Information overload can overwhelm and confuse people. They become paralyzed, unable to take any action to achieve their goals. They want actionable information. They are eager to learn from other successful people who have been there and done that. It helps them get a better result without the frustrating trial and error approach. They want to acquire skills quickly so that they can apply those skills and make money.

You can filter and package information in an actionable way. Share secrets to your success and help others acquire skills quickly. Paid products have higher quality than free information. 

You can capture all your hard-earned real life knowledge of building and running a successful business in a series of 'how-to' manuals and videos. People who want to start their own part-time business like yours can save themselves a lot of time, money and hassle by buying your products to learn what you've already figured out. 

You can sell information products based on your business development experience. You can create digital information products that teach others how to do the very same thing; in a fraction of the time and without all of the trail and error you had to go through along the way. Your customers save time, money and hassle and they will also achieve higher-quality results.

One of the big mistakes people make is thinking that whatever they know is actually a common knowledge. So they think it's not worth anything. It's human nature. Once you know something, it's easy to assume that everyone else knows it.

This mistaken belief prevents many would-be infopreneurs from even getting started. They might have a million-dollar information business locked-up in their brain, but because they can't understand why someone else would actually value that information and pay for it, they don't even try.

Why would someone buy from you ?

Why would someone pay for what I know? is a great question. Let me ask you : Why do you buy information products? You've probably purchased a 'how-to' product at some point in your life, right? Why did you buy it?

You likely bought it because the information was going to save you time, money or hassle. That's exactly why people would pay good money for what you know.

You've probably spent years gaining your knowledge and experience. Don't you think someone could save themselves a lot of time, money or hassle learning what you already know? Couldn't you help them avoid a lot of costly mistakes? Couldn't you make it easier for them to accomplish whatever they're trying to accomplish? Of course you could.

Are you now ready to learn how to build a profitable Infopreneurial business? Ok. Let's get started.

The essential ingredients of a business are:

- Customer
- Product
- Profit

No profit   --> Non-Profit
No product  --> Scam
No customer --> Bailout (or Facebook)

No one is going to give you a bailout. You are not Mark Suckerberg. We all know where scammers end up. You can start your own non-profit and hug trees after you become rich.

The sequence is important, you have to start with the customer first. You have to find out their needs and pain by talking to them. Then you focus on creating a quality product that your customers are willing to buy that turns a healthy profit for your business. 
 
Do not develop a product and then look for a customer later. This is a receipe for failure.

Understanding the Infopreneur Business Model

The Infopreneur Business Model minimizes the risk and maximizes your chances for success. It also provides you a way to overcome being overwhelmed by daunting tasks in starting a digital information business.

This is an extremely simple business model. It's very important to start with the end in mind. The fundamentals are very important. So we'll provide you with a basic blueprint to follow and we will walk you step-by-step through the business development process. We will show you what to do first, next and so-on.

We'll highlight the key principles and concepts you'll need to embrace. We'll also help you avoid the most common mistakes. This is based on lessons learned from other successful infopreneurs.

What is the difference between an infopreneur and an author?

They both create and sell content. But there are huge advantages you can enjoy when you embrace the infopreneurial approach. 

There's a reason that most infopreneurs make more money than most authors. It's because the underlying approach is very different and far more effective due to a handful of powerful concepts.

Powerful Concept #1 : Infopreneurs Establish Direct Connections

The most important concept is related to the nature of the relationship with the customer. Traditional authors don't have a clue about who's buying their books. When they sell their books through bookstores or through a typical online retailer, they know how many books are sold but they don't know who the actual customers are. Of course, the retailer knows. But they aren't about to share customer information with the author.

And what about prospects or people who are interested but not quite ready to buy yet? Even the typical retailer won't have that information, let alone the author.

With the infopreneurial approach, however, you establish a direct connection with both your customers and your prospects. You have their contact information and you can send them an email, which is something a traditional author cannot do. Being able to communicate with your prospects and customers directly is a huge win. This direct connection is the cornerstone of the infopreneurial approach.

Why? The answer leads to the next powerful concept. The concept of selling to your customers again and again, over time.

Powerful Concept #2 : Infopreneurs Drive Repeat Sales Over Time

An author has to think in terms of one-time sales. They write a book and some anonymous people buy it and that's it. Sure, if they're aware of it, some of these people may also buy the author's next book when it becomes available. But it's a hit-and-miss proposition, one that the author has relatively little control over.

An infopreneur on the other hand has a direct connection to their customers. They know who their customers are and they can contact them. As a result, an infopreneur can actively promote and sell additional information products to those same customers, over time.

This is very powerful. It makes possible another defining concept of the infopreneurial approach. The concept of being able to offer information that is highly specialized or information that may only appeal to a relatively small number of people.

Powerful Concept #3 : Infopreneurs Offer Specialized Information

Because authors have to think in terms of one-time sales, they also have to think about appealing to the masses. After all, they can't sell to the same customer over and over again, so they need a lot of those one-time sales in order to make any money. Traditional authors can never generate enough one-time sales for specialized topics to make it worthwhile.

But to an infopreneur, highly-specialized topics have a ton of potential. While a traditional author has to go broad, shooting for as many of those one-time sales as possible, an infopreneur can go deep. An infopreneur can sell more and deeper information, to a relatively small base of customers, over time.

This leads to the next infopreneurial power concept. The concept of giving prospects and customers the opportunity to stair-step their way through increasing levels of engagement and investment.

Powerful Concept #4 : Infopreneurs Offer Multiple Options and Steps

For a traditional author, there's usually only one step, buying a book. What if you're not quite ready to buy that book, yet? That's too bad and you'll have come back when you are ready. And if you do buy the book, what then? You've spent a few dollars to get the basic information in the book, but what if you want more? What if you want deeper explanations? What if you want expanded information in certain areas? What if you want someone to show you exactly how to do whatever it is, step by step? And what if you're willing to pay more money to get that deeper information?

Well, that's just too bad because the traditional author only has that one level of engagement and investment, buying the book, for a few bucks.

An infopreneur on the other hand, understands that people have different wants and needs at different times and they stair-step their informational offerings accordingly. For prospects who are interested in the topic but not quite ready to buy, the infopreneur may offer a free email newsletter or a free downloadable report. This acts as a sort of 'sample' or a way for the prospect to get engaged with the infopreneur and get comfortable with their offerings, but without spending any money yet.

Then, the infopreneur may offer them a $10 basic how-to guide or a relatively inexpensive online video tutorial. From here, the customer may be able to buy a more expensive series of videos that goes beyond the basics and provides more in-depth training. Or, they might subscribe to the infopreneur's membership site, where they get online access to all the latest and greatest information for a monthly fee.

The point is, an infopreneur typically has a range of options at different price-points. Because many of their customers will want more or deeper information over time and they'll be willing to pay more for it.

Speaking of options, another extremely important infopreneurial power concept has to do with the various ways in which information can be captured, delivered and consumed.

Powerful Concept #5 : Infopreneurs Leverage Multiple Form-Factors

There is only one way for an author to deliver their information, through a book. Even if it's a digital book, it's still a book. It's something the author has to write and something the customer has to read. And, ot everybody prefers to read. Some people prefer to learn by listening, while others prefer to lrearn by watching. And, for conveying certain types of how-to information, video and audio are just far more effective than the written word.

So, while an author is limited to the written word, delivered in the form of a book, an infopreneur can leverage a variety of form-factors, sometimes in combination, again, giving their customers a range of options and price-points along the way.

By now, it's clear that being an infopreneur is very different from being an author. Let's re-cap the major differences:

* Authors don't know who their customers are. Infopreneurs have a direct connection to their customers and prospects.
* Authors typically sell to their customers one time. Infopreneurs can sell to their customers again and again, over time.
* Authors appeal to the masses, while an infopreneur can be very successful in a highly-specialized niche.
* Authors have one, relatively low-dollar option, the book. Infopreneurs will have a wide range of options and price-points.
* Authors are limited to the written word. Infopreneurs can also leverage audio and video formats to deliver their information.

To illustrate the significance of these differences, let's compare the two approaches side-by-side in a real-world-type scenario.

Comparing the Two Approaches Side-by-Side

Jack wants to generate some passive income by teaching others how to start and run a plumbing business like he did.

Jack probably wouldn't have much luck with traditional publishers because they're looking to sell a lot of books and the potential audience for this topic would be very limited. But he could self-publish. He could publish an ebook through some of the online bookstores. With this approach, he might eventually be able to sell, on average, 40 ebooks a month, priced $10. In his first year as a self-published ebook author, Jack sells a total of 500 ebooks. He generates $5,000 in total sales.

Not bad at all. But let's explore the infopreneurial approach and see just how much money Jack could be leaving on the table.

As an infopreneur, Jack engages with his prospects and customers directly, online, through his own little website. On this website, prospects who aren't yet ready to buy can get Jack's free report, 'The Top 10 Mistakes New Plumbers Make and How to Avoid Them' by just providing their name and email address.

Through this free report and the follow-up emails that Jack periodically sends, prospects get to sample his expertise and credibility, making them much more inclined to buy his ebook. In fact, by offering this free little 'sampling' mechanism to those who aren't quite ready to buy, Jack sells 15% more people his ebook, 'How to Start and Run a Successful Plumbing Business' priced at $10.

But buying the ebook is not the end. Jack, the infopreneur knows that a number of the people who buy and read his ebook will want more. He knows that those readers who actually do start their own catering businesses will want more help along the way. More information, more advice, tips, tricks, things to watch out for, encouragement and even some inspiration.

So, Jack has a 'members only' area on his website where, once a month, he posts his latest tips, tricks and nuggets of wisdom and guidance. Readers of his ebook can get access to this 'members only' area for just $19 a month which, for someone who is just starting a business is a small price to pay for access to someone who's already 'been there and done that'. As a result, over 20% of Jack's ebook buyers end-up subscribing to his 'members only' area.

Putting it all together, at the end of hi or s first year as an infopreneur, Jack has sold 500 ebooks and 120 monthly subscriptions to his membership site. He has generated over $20,000 in sales along the way, four times more than he would have made as just an ebook author.

And, for Jack the infopreneur, it doesn't stop there. Because he has direct connection with his customers, he can continue to offer them more information, deeper information, more options and more ways to engage with him.

For example, he might offer his customers another 'how to' guide. This guide could offer much deeper information about a specific aspect of the plumbing business, maybe something like, 'How to Market Your Plumbing Business Without Spending Any Money on Advertising'. Because the information is deeper and even more specific, he might charge $20 - $30 for this type of guide.

As another example, Jack can offer a higher-level members-only subscription where, for another $10 a month, subscribers can interact with Jack directly in a monthly webinar or a conference call.

Infopreneurs Build a Valuable Customer Base

The point is that Jack isn't just making a one-time sales of an ebook. As an infopreneur, Jack is creating a customer base that his hungry for his expertise and willing to buy from him again and again, over a long period of time. In fact, in just a couple of years it's entirely possible that Jack could be making more money from his little information business than he makes from his plumbing business, with much less manual effort and direct involvement.

In this example, you will have notificed that while the infopreneurial approach is far more profitable and effective, there's a bit more to it than just uploading an ebook to an online bookstore. After all, as an infopreneur, you're essentially building a little online business. But the work involved is not at all difficult. Information businesses are very simple and straightforward to set up. You just have to know what to do and how to do it.

That's what the rest of this course is all about. In the next lessons, we'll cover the three most important steps toward becoming a successful infopreneur.

1. First, we'll help you select a topic and develop a product plan. You will evaluate your ideas in the evaluations and exercises to help you zero-in on the specific topic with the greatest odds of long-term success. And because it's so important to start with the end in mind, we'll help you develop the basic plan for your initial product line. So you're creating the right set of effective 'stair steps' and options from the very beginning.

2. Next, we'll help you get your website set up. It's not just any website. You are going to have an infopreneurial website. We will see the best practices for building an effective website. We will show you just how easy it can be to put together a winning recipe.

3. Finally, we'll talk about promoting your business and generating sales. We'll show you some very simple and effective ways to reach your target audience and get them to start engaging with you. We'll teach you about performance-based marketing and how to leverage affiliate marketing. We will show you how to stair-step your prospects and customers through greater levels of engagement and investment over time.

Module 2

Planning and Developing Your Product Offerings

It is crucial to plan before you start executing your idea. You want to avoid wasting lot of time and effort on ideas that has low probability for success. Your idea must have a market with customers that you can reach. It should also have the potential for repeat sales. Since information entrepreneurship is about selling to customers over and over again, it doesn't work well if customers don't need anything else after the first sale.

If you lose interest in the subject over time, you will fail to achieve the level of success that's possible.

In the beginning, take time to think things through and evaluate your options. This will make a huge difference in the level of success you'll eventually achieve. With a sold plan, you'll be able to more forward very quickly. But you'll move forward with the condidence of knowing that you've thought things through and you're not going to make any major mistakes. Nor will you have to go back to the drawing board at some point down the road.

This planning stage is a very straightforward process. It's just three steps that force you to think about the most important decisions you should make when you're just getting started in this business.

Revealing the Infopreneurial Blueprint

The easiest way to build a successful information business is to follow the footsteps of successful infopreneurs. Do what they did to build their businesses over time to maximize their potential. Avoid their mistakes. There is no need to reinvent the wheel by trial and error. 

There is a fundamental blueprint that underlies every successful infopreneur. It's unbelievably simple. The fundamental building blocks of their product offering has just three core elements:

Lead-capture offering
Front-end offering
Back-end offering

You don't need dozens of offerings to be very successful in this business. You can go a long way using a blueprint with just three elements. Of course, the critical thing is that they're the right three elements.


Understanding Lead-Capture Offerings

A lead is simply a prospect or someone who's interested, but not quite ready to buy yet. They're interested in the topic, interested in solving the problem or interested in learning whatever it is you might have to teach them. But they aren't yet convinced to the point of spending any money with you.

Of course, you don't want these people to just go away. You don't want to just cross your fingers, hoping they come back later. You want to capture them and engage with them. You want them to provide their name and email address, so you can cultivate them by sending them more information over time. The information you send will get them more comfortable with you and the value of your product offerings. Over time, they'll get comfortable enough to ultimately buy from you.

The general rule is that you have to give in order to get. So, a lead capture offer will generally give the prospect some piece of relevant and valuable information in exchange for their name and email address. This could be a free report or a free newsletter or a free intro video.

This free offer, along with any follow-up messages you send, provides the prospect or lead with an extremely low-risk way to sample you. This helps them to get a better feel for your expertise and credibility and better-understand how your information products can really help them. And by offering this mechanism, you'll ultimately generate many more sales. This is the Internet equivalent of getting a sample Teriyaki chicken in the mall when you are walking-by the food court.

Understanding Front-End Offerings

A front-end offering is usually the most visible product for sale. It's the product you'll see most prominently displayed when you first look at any infopreneurial business. It's essenttially the flagship product of the business. This your signature product. It's called a front-end offering because it's the product that most people will buy first; meaning, it's at the front-end of the buying relationship.

It might be an ebook or a manual or a how-to video. It could be anything. A front-end offering is the thing that steps people up from just being interested prospects or leads, to becoming your customers or people who've given you money. This is like happy-hour special at restaurants. 

Front-end products are usually in the low to medium price-range. But it's more than just a name and email address, like with the free lead-capture offering.

As the element of the blueprint that starts the buying relationship, your front-end product offering is critically important. It makes everything else about your business go, for better or worse. So you want to make sure your front-end offering provides a very good value for the money.

Make the buyers of your front-end product feel like their money was very well spent without sharing everything you know. The satisfied front-end customers are more likely to buy your back-end offerings. That's where the real money is made.

Understanding Back-End Offerings

Often, a back-end product is only made available to buyers of the front-end product. So, unless you've actually purchased the front-end product, you many not ever see what's available behind the curtain.

A back-end offering allows customers to pay more to get more. More information. Deeper information. More specific information. More access to you. Back-end offering are usually more expensive than front-end offerings. They can include things like monthly members-only programs, access to training video libraries and so on.

Of course, only a small percentage of customers will want to pay more to get more. But that's ok. Because, it doesn't take very many buyers to generate a lot of money on the back-end. The most important concept in this course is :

Most successful infopreneurs make their money on the back-end.

Jack Has the Sink Nailed...and Then Some

Jack has all three of the critical elements in the blueprint. 

1. Free Lead Capture
2. Front-end Offering
3. Back-end Offering

For lead-capture, he has his free report. A report you'll want to have even if you're just thinking about starting a catering business. From here, he offers his $10 ebook that provides a really solid overview of starting your own plumbing business as a front-end product. Then, if you want to go further and learn even more from jack, he offers his customers a members-only program for a monthly fee.

By having all three elements of the blueprint, Jack is in a much better position to maximize his potential as an infopreneur. But Jack's a great example for another very important reason. He not only has all the major blueprint elements, the lead capture, front-end and back-end; he has a very specific type of back-end offering. This type of back-end offering is very powerful.

The Power of Continuity on the Back-End

As a back-end offering, Jack has a continutity program. A continutity program is where customers agree to a series of regular purchases over time. In other words, customers agree to pay a monthly subscription fee. Jack's customers get access to a Member's Only section of his website, which he updates with new information on a monthly basis. They get charged automatically, every month, for as long as they want to continue to have that privileged access.

If it's appropriate for your particular topic, strive to have a continutity program as the back-end offering. Here's why...

Continuity programs are often easier for customers to buy. As consumers, we're accustomed to making monthly payments for things we use on a regular basis such as the gym, cable, cell phone etc. So customers understand the concept. It's just human nature that $10-20 a month is a lot more palatable than a larger one-time payment of say, $100 or $200.

Also since the monthly payments happen automatically, the customers doesn't have to do anything to keep buying from you. They can continue to get more information from you on a regular basis, without having to place another order.

For the infopreneur, continutity programs provide a steady and predictable stream of income. As you add subscribers, you're not only adding to your income this month, you're adding to your income every month, for as long as those subscribers stick around.

Infopreneurs with continuity programs on the back-end make three times more money from the same number of customers than those who don't. 

The Blueprint Addresses People in Two Stages

One reason the infopreneurial blueprint is simple yet powerful is that it addresses your audience in two fundamental groups: prospects and customers.

In most infopreneurial businesses there is a list of prospects and a list of customers. Each of these email lists is treated very differently, because the people on the lists are at different stages in their buying cycle. 

People on the prospect list aren't ready to buy yet. So you're going to communicate with them accordingly. You're going to send them information that helps them get more comfortable with you as an expert. Utimately, you want the prospects to purchase your front-end product and become a customer.

Once they move over to the customer list, assuming they're satisfied with their first purchase, you can now communicate with them in a different way. They already view you as a credible source of information, so your communication task with this list is to offer them even more information and ultimately get them to purchase your back-end offering.

The Blueprint Has Different Prices and Steps

Having offerings at different price points is a key aspect of being a successful infopreneur. This concept is baked right into the blueprint.

Your lead capture is usually free. Free from a monetary perspective as prospects do need to provide their contact information. Your front-end is going to be in the low to medium price range, usually between 10 and 50 dollars depending on the topic. And your back-end is going to be in the higher price range, anywhere from $100 for one-time purchase product to $10-50 a month for a continuity program. 

The key concept of 'stepping people up over time' is also baked into the blueprint.

You may message to a prospect for a period of days or weeks to get them to step-up from the free lead-capture offer to actually buying your front-end product. You may message to your front-end customers for weeks or months to get them to step-up to purchasing your back-end offering. And, as you add more back-end offerings over time, you may continue to message and sell to your customers for many years into the future.

The Blueprint Creates a Predictable Cash Flow Machine

Once you get this model in-place and working for you, it can become a very predictable cash flow machine with known inputs and outputs along the way.

Over time, you'll learn what percentage of leads turn into front-end customers. You'll learn what percentage of front-end customers turn into back-end buyers. You'll also learn how long each one of those processes takes. With this information, you'll be able to accurately predict how much money is going to come out of the back of the machine from what's being fed into the front of the machine.

You can also work the equation backwards. If you want to generate a certain amount of money a year from now, you'll be able to figure out how many leads you'll need to generate right now in order to make that happen.

You'll also be able to determine what it's worth to optimize the input-output ratios along the way. What if you could make some tweaks that would get 10 % more prospects to become front-end buyers? How much would that mean in increased back-end sales? What if you could make some tweaks and get 10% more front-end customers to become back-end buyers? How much more could you afford to spend promoting your front-end as a result?

The point is that even though this blueprint for planning your product offerings is extremely simple, it's incredibly powerful. And it's proven. This is basic blueprint for any successful infopreneurial business. So, don't try to reinvent the wheel. Thousands of other people have already figured out what works and you can avoid all of the trial and error they already went through by using the blueprint.

Identifying the Ideal Topic for You

You now have a solid understanding of the blueprint you want to use to build toward as you're planning your product offerings, let's move on to identifying the topic that's best for you to get started.

Why is carving-out a niche for yourself so important? When people buy 'how to' information, they want to buy it from an expert. They want to be confident that you know what you're talking about. Nearly anone can be a credible expert in something, as long as that 'something' is defined narrowly enough. Other benefits of carving out a niche include:

- Product creation is easier. You can rely on what's already in your brain without having to conduct additional research.

- You come across as being very different from the other solutions your prospects may have to choose from.

- You can command higher prices when your information is tailored to the needs of a very specific group. You can sell more back-end products, as there are fewer places for people to learn.

- Marketing is easier and more effective when you're targeting a very specific group, with a very specific set of needs, problems and desires. There's nothing more difficult than trying to be all things to all people. It's easier to write credible sales messages when you have a very specific persona in-mind. It's like you're speaking to one person that you know very well.

A good niche for most successful infopreneurs is a combination of three things: 

1. Access
2. Potential
3. Passion

Access : Reaching Groups of Prospects

Access is about reaching your potential buyers. Even the best products in the world cannot be sold if you cannot get them in-front of the buyers. Your prospects can't buy something they don't know about. Think about how accessible prospects will be when you're considering a potential topic.

How well do you know the ideal prospect in this niche?
Do you know they actually exist?
Do you have to rely solely on your imagination to conjure up this ideal prospect?

The more you know about the ideal prospect, the easier it's going to be for you to find them. 

You don't want to find them one at a time. You want to reach groups of them, all at once. 

Can you think of places where ideal prospects might gather?
Are there any websites, blogs, forums, chat rooms they might visit regularly?
Do they belong to certain associations or clubs?
Are there magazines or newsletters they might subscribe?
Are people looking for your type of information already? 

It's very important to go out and find them; it's fantastic if prospects are trying to find kind of information you are offering. You can use search engines to find out how many people are searching on your topic. [TUTORIAL IDEA]

Are there competitors already accessing this niche?

Don't be afraid of competition. If there are others selling info in this niche, it can mean that someone has already figured-out that prospects are accessible or actively looking.

Potential : Demand and Back-End Potential

Potential is about the ability to sell products and make money around the topic. Think about want instead of need. People always buy what they want. But people will only sometimes buy what they need. So be aware that it's easy to overestimate potential. 

Think about how many prospects in the niche fit this criteria. Are there a lot of them out there on the Internet? You don't need tens of thousands because you're going to sell to your customers over and over again, but you need more than a handful.

Do these prospects have money to spend?
Are they willing to spend money for the information they want? 
How much can they spend?

If the answer is no, you will end up selling less and at a lower price.

The real money is in the back-end. You want to think about whether prospects in this niche will be hungry for more.

Will some of them want to go further and learn more?
Will they be willing to pay more to get more?
Do they have ongoing educational needs that you can satisfy over time?

You are not looking to just sell a $10 ebook and that's all. You're looking to build a customer base you can sell to again and again, over a long period of time.

Passion : Holding Your Interest Over Time

Lack of passion turns product creation into drudgery and you have very little interest for what you are doing every day.

Consider how passionate you are about the subject matter, because you're going to be immersed in it for a long time. Ask yourself:

- Is this something you're interested in anyway? Even if you weren't doing this business, would be involved in this niche?

- Does creating information products for this niche seem like fun to you?

- Do you like the people that are involved in this niche? Do you empathize with your prospects and can you put yourself in their shoes? Are prospects just a means to an end and something you have to tolerate along the way?

- Can you see yourself in this niche five years from now?

You're building a business for the long-term. So ask yourself whether you can maintain the enthusiasm in the long run. 

Evaluating the Different Possibilities

Go through this exercise even if you already have an idea in mind. You might discover something that's a better fit for you. Use the worksheet provided and take an inventory of everything you know.

Think about your profession or work experiences. 

Do you know something or have you learned something that others might want to know? Such as starting or running a business, being successful in a particular job?
How about performing a specific activity or business function?

Think about your hobbies and pastimes. 

Do you know a lot about a particular hobby?
Have you figured-out some things that others might want to know about the hobby?

Think about your life experiences. 

What obstacles and challenges have you overcome in life?

The point is that you probably know more than you think you do. Ask your friends and family to get a different perspective. Take the Strenghts Finder 2.0 online test. Take inventory and explore the various possibilities. Once you've identified a few possibilities, evaluate each of the possibilities by giving them a score of 'high', 'medium' or 'low' on each of the three criteria: 

1. Access
2. Potential
3. Passion

Plugin Good to Great circles here.

This exercise is not about exact quantifications. You probably don't know how much potential exists for a given possibility. But you can evaluate the possibilities relative to each other.

Deciding on Your Niche or Topic

It's now time to make a decision. The ideal topic becomes obvious if you work through the exercises. The process of thinking through these issues has a way of revealing the best choice along the way.

All other things being equal, look at the topic you're most passionate about. Passion in the topic makes everything about this business a bit easier. It's the fuel that will keep you going; pushing through the challenges and figuring things out on the way.

The decision to pursue a topic doesn't shut the door on the other possibilities. You're just getting started with the odds stacked in your favor. You have to start somewhere. It's impossible to succeed without intense focus early on.

At some point down the road, you can certainly consider creating another line of products for an entirely different niche you might be interested in. Though, it is preferable to target the same niche since it makes the lifetime value of the customer very high. The infopreneur business can be replicated. You can create as many as you want. If they are in different markets the marketing cost will be higher. It requires more work. So, it's not ideal.

So don't think you're limiting yourself by choosing one niche to pursue. You're prioritizing your efforts and focusing your energies. The possibilities are endless but you have to start somewhere.

Using the Blueprint to Plan Your Offerings

It's finally time to plan and develop your initial product offerings. This step is going to be easier because you're going to use the blueprint as your guide. The blueprint is really powerful and it underlies nearly every successful inforpreneurial venture.

By using the blueprint to plan your product offerings, you'll be way ahead of the game right from the beginning. From the very start, you'll have all the elements in-place to maximize your potential as an infopreneur. Of course, you'll still have to tweak and improve things along the way. But you'll have the basic framework that's taken other people years to discover.

How should you use the blueprint? You'll simply plan and develop an offering in each of the three major buckets, lead-capture, front-end and back-end.

These offerings can take a variety of forms. For example, you might have a 5-7 page report as a lead-capture offering. This might be a PDF that prospects download in exchange for their name and email address. It could be a free email newsletter subscription or access to introductory video.

For a front-end offering, you might sell an hour-long how-to video. It could be a 100 page training manual or online access to a series of interviews in audio format.

On the back-end, you might offer customers a members-only continuity program. It could be access to a complete series of videos or combo package that contains videos, audios, written reports and so on.

Consider the Format of Your Offerings

Make sure that the type of offering matches the needs and preferences of the people in your niche as well as your own capabilities from a product creation standpoint. Does your audience prefer to read? Do they prefer audio and video content? Strive to offer the format the audience prefers whenever possible.

Of course, preferences often depend on the nature of the content. Even if their normal preference is for written material, prospects and customers will expect to see certain kinds of how-to information presented in video form because it makes it easier to see how to do something.

You also need to think about how the different formats is perceived from a value perspective. Will the audience pay more for videos? 

Of course, you'll want to assess your own capabilities, too. For example, if you don't know how to generate a video, don't spend months to figure it out. Go with the written word for now. You can always add video later.

Brainstorming Possibilities in Each Area

Use the worksheet and brainstorm some potential offerings in each area of the infopreneurial blueprint. Be as specific as possible about the title and description of the potential offering.

Why? Because your prospects and customers will be pay attention to the title and description to decide whether it's something they really want or not. So you should work with titles right from the beginning. The more ideas you can come-up with at this stage, the better.

For inspiration, you can take a look at the 'how-to' section of the bookstore. See what others are offering on the Internet. You can borrow from it without copying. For example, Jack the plumber noticed a report titled, 'The 10 Mistakes Docters Make and How to Avoid Them'. He thought it was a compelling title, so he adapted it to his niche and it became, 'The 10 Mistakes New Plumbers Make and How to Avoid Them'.

Studies have shown that people will go to much greater lengths to avoid making a mistake or avoid losing something. As humans we're wired to avoid loss or pain. Keep this principle in mind, particularly for your lead-capture offer.
