How to Install Alpha SSL certificate using Moonshine for Rails 4.1 

Steps
======
-------

Step 1
-------

When you generate the CSR request, do not provide pass phrase. If you provide the passphrase you can still install successfully by removing the password from the key:

```sh
openssl rsa -in /path/to/originalkeywithpass.key -out /path/to/newkeywithnopass.key
```
Use the newkeywithnopass.key in moonshine.yml. This is explained below. 

Step 2
-------

When you purchase your SSL certificate from Alpha SSL, you will get the following certificates:

1. GlobalSign Root CA Certificate
2. AlphaSSL intermediate Certificate (intermediate_domain.crt)
3. Your domain SSL Certificate (yourdomain.com.crt)

Copy the intermediate certificate, your domain certificate and the key file to your server /home/rails/certs folder.

Step 3
---------

Specify the values in moonshine.yml:

```ruby
:ssl:
  :certificate_file: /home/rails/certs/yourdomain.com.crt
  :certificate_key_file: /home/rails/certs/yourdomain.key
  :certificate_chain_file: /home/rails/certs/intermediate_domain.crt
```

Step 4
------

Uncomment:

```ruby
config.force_ssl = true
```

in production.rb of your Rails application.

Step 5
--------

Check in your code and do a cap deploy. Enjoy!
