Problem:
Upgrading from Rails 4.1.4 to Rails 4.1.8

rails -v
Bundler is using a binstub that was created for a different gem.
This is deprecated, in future versions you may need to `bundle binstub rails` to work around a system/bundle conflict.
Rails 4.1.8


Fix:
$rm -rf bin/*
$bundle exec rake rails:update:bin
zepho-mac-pro:lafon zepho$ rails -v
Rails 4.1.8
