---------

Step 1
---------

Create webrick.rb with the following code:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'webrick'
include WEBrick
s = HTTPServer.new(
    :Port => 3000,
    :DocumentRoot => File.join(Dir.pwd, "/html")
)
trap("INT") { s.shutdown }
s.start
```

Step 2
---------

Check the permissions on webrick.rb.

```sh
$ls -l webrick.rb 
-rw-r--r--  1 zepho  staff  179 May 16 13:32 webrick.rb
```

Give execute permissions to the script by running:

```sh
$chmod a+x webrick.rb
```

Check the permissions:

```sh
-rwxr-xr-x  1 zepho  staff  179 May 16 13:32 webrick.rb
```

Step 3
---------

Create html directory with index.html:

```sh
Hello Static Page
```

Step 4
---------

Run the script:

```sh
$ruby webrick.rb
```

Step 5
---------

Browse to http://localhost:3000. You will see the contents of index.html file: Hello Static Page in the browser.

Step 6
---------

Copy the script to local cgi-bin folder on the server.

Step 7
---------

Execute it from a browser by going to your domain www.example.com.

Step 8
---------

Use Ctrl+C to stop the server.

Summary
========
---------

In this article, we wrote a simple hello world program that displays a static page. In subsequent articles of this series, we will create dynamic pages that will be executed on the server and display on the browser as a webpage.
