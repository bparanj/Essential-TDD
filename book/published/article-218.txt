Docker Basics : Hello World


Objective
=========
---------

To run a 'hello world' program using Docker container.

Steps
=========
---------

Step 1
---------

Run:

```sh
$ docker run busybox echo hello world
```

Busybox is a small and lean image. You will see:

```sh
Unable to find image 'busybox:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from busybox
cf2616975b4a: Pull complete 
6ce2e90b0bc7: Pull complete 
8c2e06607696: Already exists 
busybox:latest: The image you are pulling has been verified. Important: image verification is a tech preview feature and should not be relied on to provide security.
Digest: sha256:38a203e1986cf79639cfb9b2e1d6e773de84002feea2d4eb006b52004ee8502d
Status: Downloaded newer image for busybox:latest
hello world
```

We ran a single process in the docker container that echo'ed 'hello world'. 

Step 2
---------

The Busybox image doesn't do much. Let's use a beefier Ubuntu image now.

```sh
$ docker pull ubuntu:latest
```

You will see:

```sh
atest: Pulling from ubuntu
428b411c28f0: Downloading [=========================>                         ] 33.52 MB/65.77 MB
435050075b3f: Download complete 
9fd3c8c9af32: Download complete 
6d4946999d4f: Download complete 
```

It will take a few minutes to complete.

```sh

435050075b3f: Pull complete 
9fd3c8c9af32: Pull complete

```

Discussion
========
---------

Docker is a client-server application. It consists of Docker daemon which is the Docker server. It receives and processes incoming Docker API requests. The Docker client is a command line tool that allows us to talk to the Docker daemon via the Docker API. Let's now run the 'hello world' again using the latest Ubuntu.

Step 3
---------

```sh
$ docker run ubuntu echo hello world
```

You will see: **hello world**.

Summary
========
---------

In this article, we wrote a simple 'hello world' program using Docker container.
