Stripe Recurring Billing Part 3

Jeff Thomas has written a blog post on [Integration tests with Stripe](http://www.jeffthomas.xyz/integration-tests-with-stripe/ 'Integration tests with Stripe'). I followed his instructions, but I was not able to get it working. So, I had to use just Capybara with RSpec. In this article you will learn how to check the API credentials using a rake task and how to write integration tests using Capybara for testing the subscription feature using Stripe API.

Credentials Check
==========
----------

Here is a rake task that you can use to make sure that the Stripe credentials are defined.

```ruby
namespace :stripe do
  task :credentials_check => :environment do
    message = <<ERROR 
Stripe Credentials is not set. Define the following Stripe Environment variables.

export STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY='pk_test_your publishable key' 
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY='sk_test_your secret key'

Check config/initializers/stripe.rb for more details on this works.
ERROR
              
    if Rails.configuration.stripe[:secret_key].blank?
      puts message
    else
      begin
        Stripe::Account.retrieve
        puts "Stripe Secret Key is defined properly"
      rescue  Stripe::AuthenticationError => e
        puts "Stripe Secret Key is not correct"
      end
    end
  end

end
```

Ideally, the API should provide something similar to ping to verify the credentials. Unfortunately, there is no API for credentials check. The closest thing that I could find is retrieving the Stripe account details for the website owner who wants to charge their customers using Stripe API.

Integration Tests using Feature Specs
==========
----------

Step 1
----------

Add the following gems to the Gemfile.

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'selenium-webdriver'
end
```

Step 2
----------

Run bundle.

Step 3
----------

Create a features directory under spec folder. Create a file subscribe_spec.rb under the features directory with the following contents.

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

feature 'Subscription' do
  scenario 'Customer subscribes to Gold plan', js: true do
    visit "/subscriptions/new"
    fill_in "Card Number", with: '4242424242424242'
    page.select '10', from: "card_month"
    page.select '2029', from: 'card_year'
    
    click_button 'Subscribe Me'
    expect(page).to have_content('You have been subscribed to Gold.')
  end
end
```

Step 4 
----------

Run the feature spec.

```ruby
$spec/features/subscribe_spec.rb 
```

1. Add the following gems to the Gemfile.

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'stripe-ruby-mock'
  gem 'slim'
end
```

2. Add the following to the top of the spec/rails_helper.rb

```ruby
require 'stripe_mock'

StripeMock.spawn_server
```

3. Create a features directory under spec folder. Create a file subscribe_spec.rb under the features directory with the following contents.

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

feature 'Subscription' do
  scenario 'Customer subscribes Gold plan', js: true do

  end
end
```

This gives error:
