RSpec 3.1 Basics : Stubs, Mocks and Verifying Double

Objective
=========
---------

To learn the new syntax for using stubs, mocks and verifying doubles in RSpec 3.1

Stubs
=====
-----

```ruby
class Book
end

describe Book do
  it 'rspec 3 stub syntax example' do
    book = double('book')  
    allow(book).to receive(:name) { 'Get Rich Quick'}
    
    expect(book.name).to eq("Get Rich Quick")
  end  
  
end
```

```sh
$ rspec stub_spec.rb --color --format doc
```

```ruby
Book
  rspec 3 stub syntax example

Finished in 0.00896 seconds (files took 0.11378 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures
```

Verifying Double
================
----------------

Create verifying_double_spec.rb with the following code.

```ruby
class Book
end

describe Book do
  it 'rspec 3 stub syntax example' do
    book = instance_double('book')  
    allow(book).to receive(:name) { 'Get Rich Quick'}
    
    expect(book.name).to eq("Get Rich Quick")
  end    
end
```

Run it.

```ruby
$rspec verifying_double_spec.rb --color --format doc
```

You will get the following error:

```sh
Book
  rspec 3 stub syntax example (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) Book rspec 3 stub syntax example
     Failure/Error: allow(book).to receive(:name) { 'Get Rich Quick'}
       Book does not implement: name
     # ./verifying_double_spec.rb:10:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.0083 seconds (files took 0.11439 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./verifying_double_spec.rb:8 # Book rspec 3 stub syntax example
```

Let's define the name method.

```ruby
class Book
  def name
    
  end
end
```

Run the test again.

```ruby
rspec verifying_double_spec.rb --color --format doc

Book
  rspec 3 stub syntax example

Finished in 0.00908 seconds (files took 0.11459 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures
```

Mocks
=======
-------

Create message_expectations_spec.rb

```ruby
class Account
  def close
    @logger.account_closed(self)
  end
  
  def logger=(l)
    @logger = l
  end
end

describe Account do
  context "when closed" do
    it "logs an 'account closed' message" do
      logger = double()
      account = Account.new
      account.logger = logger

      expect(logger).to receive(:account_closed).with(account)

      account.close
    end
  end
end
```

Run the test.

```sh
$ rspec message_expectations_spec.rb --color --format doc
```

This test passes.

```sh
Account
  when closed
    logs an 'account closed' message

Finished in 0.00846 seconds (files took 0.11452 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures
```

Summary
=======
-------

In this article you learned the new syntax for using Mocks, Stubs and Verifying doubles in RSpec 3.1.
