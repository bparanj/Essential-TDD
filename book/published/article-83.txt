Subversion Tips


Tree conflicts in SVN
---------------

```sh
svn resolve --accept working -R .
```

Where . is the directory in conflict


Compare 
---------------

To compare working copy with all of its local changes to the latest version of that tree in the repository

```sh
svn diff -r HEAD
```

Create a Branch
---------------

```sh
svn copy svn+ssh://host.example.com/repos/project/trunk \
           svn+ssh://host.example.com/repos/project/branches/NAME_OF_BRANCH \
      -m "Creating a branch of project"
```

Limit Log Output
---------------

How to limit svn log output to a given number of entries. Use limit option:

```sh
svn log -l 5
```

Moving a Repo from SVN to GIT
===============
---------------

Step 1
---------------

Use git-svn to clone the repository:

```sh
git svn clone --stdlayout svn+ssh:/svn/srv/svn/zephoinc/<your repo>
```

This will take a while.

Step 2
---------------

Run this script to create git tags from svn tags

```sh
cd <your repo>

git for-each-ref --format="%(refname:short) %(objectname)" refs/remotes/tags |  cut -d / -f 2- |
while read ref
do
  echo git tag -a $ref -m 'import tag from svn'
done
```

Remove the echo to make it actually do work. Run 

```sh
git tag 
```

to verify that the tags were actually created.

Step 3
---------------

Add a remote repo and push everything.

```sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:zepho-inc/<your repo>.git
git push
git push --tags
```
