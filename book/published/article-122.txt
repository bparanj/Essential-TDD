SQL Basics : Update and Delete

Objective
==========
----------

To learn how to use UPDATE and DELETE statements to update and delete rows in a table.

Update
==========
----------

To update data in a table the UPDATE statement is used. Let's take a look at the existing data in the customers table.

```sh
sqlite> select * from customers;
id          name         email               
----------  -----------  --------------------
1           Big Spender  bspender@example.com
2           Big Saver    bsaver@example.com  
3           Big Saver    bsaver2@example.com 
4           Big Browser  browser@example.com 
```

Let's now update the email for the customer with id = 1.

```sh
sqlite> update customers
   ...> set email = 'bspender@spender.com'
   ...> where id = 1;
```

The update statement takes the name of table to be updated followed by the SET keyword with the column name set to a new value. In this example we are updating just one row because of the WHERE condition. Now the change made can be verified by looking at the customers table.

```sh
sqlite> select * from customers;
id          name         email               
----------  -----------  --------------------
1           Big Spender  bspender@spender.com
2           Big Saver    bsaver@example.com  
3           Big Saver    bsaver2@example.com 
4           Big Browser  browser@example.com
```

Let's now look at updating more than one column. 

```sh
sqlite> update customers
   ...> set name = 'Bugs Bunny',
   ...>     email = 'bbunny@disney.com'
   ...> where id = 1;
```

The only difference here is that we specify multiple columns to be updated separated by comma after the SET keyword.

```sh
sqlite> select * from customers;
id          name        email            
----------  ----------  -----------------
1           Bugs Bunny  bbunny@disney.com
2           Big Saver   bsaver@example.co
3           Big Saver   bsaver2@example.c
4           Big Browse  browser@example.c
```

We see that both both the name and email has been changed to the new values. To display the entire value for email column, let's increase the width of that column.

```sh
sqlite> .width 2 25 25
sqlite> select * from customers;
id  name                       email                    
--  -------------------------  -------------------------
1   Bugs Bunny                 bbunny@disney.com        
2   Big Saver                  bsaver@example.com       
3   Big Saver                  bsaver2@example.com      
4   Big Browser                browser@example.com
```

Delete
==========
----------

The DELETE statement is used to remove data from a table. Here is the list of customers before delete.

```sh
sqlite> select * from customers;
id  name                       email                    
--  -------------------------  -------------------------
1   Bugs Bunny                 bbunny@disney.com        
2   Big Saver                  bsaver@example.com       
3   Big Saver                  bsaver2@example.com      
4   Big Browser                browser@example.com      
```

Let's delete the last record in the customers table.

```sh
sqlite> delete from customers
   ...> where id = 4;
```

You can see that the customer 'Big Browser' is not in customers table.

```sh
sqlite> select * from customers;
id  name                       email                    
--  -------------------------  -------------------------
1   Bugs Bunny                 bbunny@disney.com        
2   Big Saver                  bsaver@example.com       
3   Big Saver                  bsaver2@example.com
```

If you don't provide the WHERE clause in the delete statement, all records will be deleted.

```sh
sqlite> delete from customers;
sqlite> select count(*) from customers;
count
--
0 
```
