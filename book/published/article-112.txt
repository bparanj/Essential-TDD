SQL Basics : Search Conditions

Objective
==========
----------

In this lesson, you will learn how to use the WHERE clause in SELECT statement to filter data.

Where Clause
==========
----------

To avoid retrieving large number of records we specify search criteria to extract a subset of the table's data.

```sh
sqlite> select * from users where id > 5;
id          first_name  last_name   email            
----------  ----------  ----------  -----------------
6           tasmanian   devil       tdevil@disney.com
7           tweety      bird        tweety@disney.com
8           elmer       fudd        efudd@disney.com 
9           speedy      gonzales    gonzales@disney.c
10          yosemite    sam         sam@disney.com
```

Here the where clause is used as the filter condition to retrieve records with primary key greater than 5. 

Where Clause Operator
==========
----------

The example above used greater than as the operator for the search criteria. We can also use any of the following operators:

1. Equality
2. Non-Equality
3. Less than
4. Less than or equal to
5. Not less than
6. Greater than
7. Greater than or equal to
8. Not greater than
9. Between two values
10. Is a NULL value

Here is the equality operator as the filter condition:

```sh
sqlite> select * from users where id = 5;
id          first_name  last_name   email          
----------  ----------  ----------  ---------------
5           pluto       pet         pdog@disney.com
```

Here is the non-equality operator as the filter condition:

```sh
sqlite> select * from users where first_name <> 'pluto';
id          first_name  last_name   email            
----------  ----------  ----------  -----------------
1           bugs        bunny       bbunny@disney.com
2           daffy       duck        daffy@disney.com 
3           porky       pig         ppig@disney.com  
6           tasmanian   devil       tdevil@disney.com
7           tweety      bird        tweety@disney.com
8           elmer       fudd        efudd@disney.com 
9           speedy      gonzales    gonzales@disney.c
10          yosemite    sam         sam@disney.com
```

The result filters out two of the records which contains pluto as the first_name.

Exercise
==========
----------

Change the above non-equality query to use != instead of <>. What do you see as the result?

Between a Range
----------

We need to specify the beginning and end of the range as follows:

```sh
sqlite> select * from users where id between 5 and 10;
id          first_name  last_name   email          
----------  ----------  ----------  ---------------
5           pluto       pet         pdog@disney.com
6           tasmanian   devil       tdevil@disney.c
7           tweety      bird        tweety@disney.c
8           elmer       fudd        efudd@disney.co
9           speedy      gonzales    gonzales@disney
10          yosemite    sam         sam@disney.com
```

Here we retrieve all records between 5 and 10, where 5 is the beginning and 10 is the end of the range. The range values is separated by the AND keyword.

NULL Value
----------

When a column does not have any value, it contains a NULL value. Since our database does not contain any record with NULL value, let's first insert a record with NULL value for last_name by not providing a value in the insert statement.

```sh
sqlite> select * from users where last_name is NULL;
sqlite> INSERT INTO users(id, first_name, email)
   ...> VALUES(12,'bosko', 'bosko@disney.com');
sqlite> select * from users where last_name is NULL;
id          first_name  last_name   email         
----------  ----------  ----------  --------------
12          bosko                   bosko@disney.com
```

In this case, bosko does not have any last_name, it is NULL in database terminology.

Exercise
==========
----------

Experiment with the remaining where clause operators from the list shown in the Where Clause Operator section by querying the users table.


Summary
==========
