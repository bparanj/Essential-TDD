Demystifying the Gem Version Comparison


Comparing Gem Versions in Ruby
========
---------

I read the [How to compare gem versions in Ruby](https://medium.com/@extendsmymind/how-to-compare-version-strings-in-ruby-ced0916a4b71#.m6qpi1gvq 'How to compare version strings in Ruby'). Anderson Dias shows us how we can compare using < and > operators. How is this implemented in Ruby gems? I know that comparison is made possible by implementing the <=> method. But where is it in the source code? If you git clone https://github.com/rubygems/gems.git you cannot see the implementation for <=>. So let's find out where it is defined.

```ruby
 irb
> v = Gem::Version.new('2.1.2')
> v.respond_to?(:<=>)
 => true 
> v.method(:<=>).source_location
 => ["/Users/bparanj/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/lib/ruby/2.2.0/rubygems/version.rb", 330] 
```

Ruby Gems Implementation of <=> Method
========
---------

Open the version.rb in your editor and look at line 330:

```ruby
  ##
  # Compares this version with +other+ returning -1, 0, or 1 if the
  # other version is larger, the same, or smaller than this
  # one. Attempts to compare to something that's not a
  # <tt>Gem::Version</tt> return +nil+.

  def <=> other
    return unless Gem::Version === other
    return 0 if @version == other.version

    lhsegments = segments
    rhsegments = other.segments

    lhsize = lhsegments.size
    rhsize = rhsegments.size
    limit  = (lhsize > rhsize ? lhsize : rhsize) - 1

    i = 0

    while i <= limit
      lhs, rhs = lhsegments[i] || 0, rhsegments[i] || 0
      i += 1

      next      if lhs == rhs
      return -1 if String  === lhs && Numeric === rhs
      return  1 if Numeric === lhs && String  === rhs

      return lhs <=> rhs
    end

    return 0
  end
```

You can see that ruby gems that ships as part of Ruby has the implementation for the <=> method. This is another example of the comparable basic concepts we saw in [Ruby Comparable Basics](https://www.rubyplus.com/articles/2791 'Ruby Comparable Basics'). This allows us to even sort an array of gem versions.

Summary
========
---------

We can find the implementation of any given method by using source_location method. This is faster than using grep, ack or ag. You learned how the gem comparisons is implemented in ruby gems that comes shipped with Ruby.
