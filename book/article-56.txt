Character to Number Conversion


Convert the character representation of an integer to it's decimal format.

Example

Convert 4 character sequence '1984' to the decimal number 1984.

Diagram goes here

To convert, 49 needs to be converted to 1000, 57 to 900, 56 to 80 and 52 to 4 units.

To get the decimal digit we have to subtract 48 (ASCII value of character '0')
Show ASCII table to illustrate why.

x = ord('9')
x = 57
y = ord('0')
y = 48
n = 57 - 48 = 9

Constructing the number

1 --> 1  --> 1
9 --> 1 x 10 + 9 --> 19
8 --> 19 x 10 + 8 --> 198
4 --> 198 x 10 + 4 --> 1984

The shifting to the left mechanism can be obtained at each step by multiplying the previous decimal value by 10 and adding it to current decimal digit.
