Essential Skills for Test Driven Development

Mathematician Guass
===================
-------------------

Human mind thinks in a sequential manner. We have to learn how to break this tendency. Why do we need to break it?

Because the first and obvious solution is not the best solution. 

Improving the performance by using a different algorithm can break lot of tests.


- How to see the big picture ?
- How to recognize the patterns ?


This diagram describes how Gaull did Solution Domain Analysis

1, 2, 3, .......... 98, 99, 100

1 + 100 = 101
2 + 99  = 101
3 + 98  = 101 and so on

Gauss took a big picture view. He saw the forest (entire data set) instead of one tree at a time (one number at a time). He found the relationship between data by analysing the solution domain. He recognized patterns by working through a concrete example and generalized the solution.

He saw the relationship between data. He extended the solution to derive the generalization.

Einstein on Problem Solving
===================
-------------------

If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about the solutions.


Transformation Priority Premise is a tool. Learn when to use it. It's not a silver bullet. Challenge yourself to use the top of the list transformations.
