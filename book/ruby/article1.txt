Lesson 1 : Hello World

print 'Hello World'

Refer Ruby docs and explain the print method.

puts 'Hello World'

What is the difference between puts and print?

puts stands for 'put string', it adds a new line after printing the output.

Lesson 2 : Greet

name = gets

print "Hello #{name}"

The gets call gets the user input and we assign it an identifier called name. The identifier name is called a variable. It is called a variable because the value held by the variable can change. #{} is used to plugin the value held by name variable into the string. It is called string interpolation.

Contrast with :

print 'Hello #{name}'

Explain the difference between single and double quotes.
