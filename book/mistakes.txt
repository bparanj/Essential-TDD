These are the mistakes that must be demonstrated in the video:

1. No relationship between the Doc string and the test.
2. Not recognizing the pattern to create an abstract solution.
3. Changing the production code and test code before running the test.
4. Writing tests that are semantically wrong.
5. Getting stuck : Writing test that is too large.
