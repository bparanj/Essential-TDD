To learn about setting environment variables in your projects.

Steps
=========
---------

Step 1
---------

You can set the environment variable in a terminal like this:

```sh
$export JUNK='test'
```

Step 2
---------

 In irb, you can read the value like this:

```ruby
ENV['JUNK']
```

Step 3
---------

Don't check for nil for the existence of environment variables.

```sh
ENV['JUNK'].nil?
```

Step 4
---------

Check for the existence of the key in ENV hash like this:

```sh
ENV.has_key?('JUNK')
```

Step 5
---------

This makes your conditionals in yml files easier to read. So instead of doing this:

```sh
ENV['JUNK'].nil?? ENV['JUNK'] : 'dev'
```

You can do:

```sh
ENV.has_key?('JUNK')? ENV['JUNK'] : 'dev'
```

This also prevents nil exceptions in your code.
