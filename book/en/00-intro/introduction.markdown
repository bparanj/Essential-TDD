# Chapter 1 : Background #

## What is Test Driven Development? ##

You write a test first before you write the code. You use the tests to drive the design.

It uses one of the XP concepts : Test-First programming to achieve another XP concept : Emergent Design.

In Emergent Design you start delivering functionality that has business value and let the design emerge. You will deliver functionality A with unit tests and then build functionality B. Then refactor to reduce duplication due to A and B and let the design emerge.

## Origins of Test Driven Development ## 

- Extreme Programming Explained - Embrace Change by Kent Beck
- Refactoring by Martin Fowler

## Why TDD ? ## 

- It results in simple design and minimal code.
- Higher quality code due to less defects
- Lower cost to maintain
- Brings fun back to programming

## When is TDD applicable? ## 

Diagram of Know - Don't Know grid. TODO

- Learning Tests
- Obvious Implementation

## When is TDD not applicable? ## 

- Multi-threading
- Prototyping
- Exploratory work such as Architectural spike
- Checking the structure of user interfaces such as HTML
- Testing usability of user interfaces

## What makes TDD difficult ## 

- Doing TDD without pair programming. TDD and pair programming are complementary.
- Existing code base with no tests
- Bad design
- Dependencies

## Summary ##

In this chapter we learned the what, why, when of Test Driven Development. In the next chapter you will about the specification and implementation.
