Rails 4.2

ActiveJob
----------

```ruby
class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
  queue_as :my_jobs

  def perform(record)
    record.do_work
  end
end
```

Enqueue a job like so:

```ruby
MyJob.enqueue record  # Enqueue a job to be performed as soon the queueing system is free.
```

You can now pass live Active Record objects to your job.

class VideoProcessJob < ActiveJob::Base
    queue_as :default

    def perform(video)
      video.process
    end
end
