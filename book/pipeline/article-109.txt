1. 

Select the playground database that we created in the previous article. Click on View dropdown and select 'Temporary View'. This gives you the View Code section to enter Map Function.

2

For the Map Function, enter:

```javascript
function(doc) {
  emit(doc._id, doc);
}
```

By default, you see the language is javascript. Click 'Run' button, you can see the result on the browser. You will see three documents. This map function takes one parameter called doc. Our map function calls the emit(key, value) function with doc._id and doc as the arguments.

3

Instead of getting the _id and the entire document, let's retrieve only the street name and the street number.

```javascript
function(doc) {
  emit(doc.street.name, doc.street.number);
}
```

In this case, there is only one document that has street name and number. So, you only see one document in the result.
