What vs How in Test Driven Development

Example #1 for What vs How
===========================

Music sheet is not music. It is description of music. This is the 'What' or Logical Design.

Music is played using musical instruments. This is the 'How' or the Physical Design. There are many physical designs for a given logical design.

Example #2 for What vs How
===========================

John Lennon wrote the song Come Together. This is the 'What'. The examples of 'How' in this case are the performances of :

- Beatles
- Aerosmith
- Michael Jackson

to the same song Come Together.

Separate Logical Design from Physical Design 
======================================================

How do you separate What from How in our code? Chris Stevenson's TestDox style expresses the subject in the code as part of a sentence.

- A Sheep eats grass
- A Sheep bleats when frightened
- A Sheep produces delicious milk
- A Sheep moves away from sheep dogs

This can be automatically converted to specifications in code :

describe Sheep do
  it 'eats grass'
  it 'bleats when frightened'
  it 'produces delicious milk'
  it 'moves away from sheep dogs'
end

When you think about the system from outside-in fashion you focus on intent. You focus on what you are doing rather than the implementation which is the 'how'.
