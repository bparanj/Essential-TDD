Answer to the Exercise in Calculator example

When a contract is broken throw exception. In this example : raise 'Cannot divide by 0'
Incremental Development and Design (Code simplicity book)

describe Calculator do
  it 'should add given two numbers'
	it 'should subtract given two numbers'

end


Do the multiplication and division and introduce new concepts. Link to this article as the answers to the exercises in the previous article.

1. Read the book Code Simplicity by Max Kanat-Alexander. It explains Incremental Development and Incremental Design with the calculator as an example in Chapter 5 : Change. It is less than 100 pages, very easy to read and filled with great insights on software development.

2. Refer the (rspec documentation):https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs for examples on how to use the rspec API. 




1. Write specs for the following statements:
   - It should subtract given two numbers
	 - It should multiply given two numbers
	 - It should divide given two numbers

2. Write specs for edge cases such as invalid input, division by 0 etc.

3. Create a .rspec file with the following contents

```ruby
--color
--format documentation
```

Now you can run the specs without giving it any options like this:

```ruby
rspec calculator_spec.rb
```

What do you see as the output in the terminal?
