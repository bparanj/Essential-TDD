>> In specifying behavior, tests should not simply be accurate: they must also be precise. The result of adding an item to an empty collection is not simply that it is not empty: it is that the collection now has a single item and that the single item held is the item added. Two or more items would qualify as not empty and would also be wrong. A single item of a different value would also be wrong.
