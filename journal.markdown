Fragile Tests

Overspecifying : Specifying purely internal behavior. Using mocks instead of stubs. 
Separate tests that measure progress from those that catch regressions.
Start testing with the simplest success case.
Write the test that you would want to read.
Improve diagnostics
Develop from the inputs to the outputs.
Unit test behavior not methods
Listen to the tests.
Not listening to tests : Using Spork to test instead of 
Tuning the cycle.
Hide the right info.
Context Independent 
DAS Screencast : alice.should_receive(:update_attributes).with(happiness => 60). Ties the test to implementation.
Better way: 
expect do
alice.nice_walk
end.to increase(:happiness).by(60)
This specifies outcomes and does not break when implementation changes (or upgrade of framework).
