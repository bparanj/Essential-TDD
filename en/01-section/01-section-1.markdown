# Section 1 : Basics #

This section is about the basics of TDD. It introduces the concepts using code exercises. It is deliberately code centric with concise explanation. You will get the most benefit out of the book by first making an attempt to write the tests by reading the problem description in each example. Then look at the solution and compare it with your version. If you are stuck just type in the code from the book and run the examples to see how it works. The chapters are arranged in a progressively increasing level of complexity. Subsequent chapters build on the concepts already introduced.
