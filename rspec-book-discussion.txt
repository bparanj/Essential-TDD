The problem here is the Game object has no purpose. It is ignoring the system boundary and is
tightly coupled to the implementation.
When I register on the site:

1. Activation email should be sent.
2. Account must be verified
3. User record must be created
4. I must be able to login 

Which one of the above is useful to test?
