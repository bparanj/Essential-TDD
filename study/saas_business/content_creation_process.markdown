# Content Creation Process #

## Developing a Keyword Strategy ##

1. Talk to people to find out what keyword phrases used by customers to search online. 
2. Then find out what types of questions these customers are asking.
3. Come up with a list of 25 keywords.
4. Use Google Keyword Planner. Paste the list of keywords and generate more keyword ideas.
5. Evaluate this list, choose keywords that are relevant and provide the right context for someone researching what you have to offer. 
6. Select the most important topics from this keyword research to write articles that also supports a sustainable frequency.
7. Use this keyword list to create content for the blog for the next 6 months.

## Finding the Best Writer ##

1. Use Zerys.
2. Choose categories and subcategories for your industry and look for writers with 4 and 5 stars. Look for a low rejection rate (<= 5%), over 500 pages approved and native English speakers.
3. Vet the writers to figure out which writers are best match. Eventually we want to have a very small list of writers. This will allow the writers to become content experts and thought leaders in your industry.

Look at the number of completed pages (more the better), their experience in the subject matter and ability to meet deadlines.

## Developing Titles and Topics ##

Titles with 'How to' and numbers such as '5 Tips for' and '7 Excellent Strategies to' are ideal. What is the latest trends in the industry? What are people talking about?

### Brainstorming Tools ###

1. www.alltop.com
You can find out about what's being talked about and find resources to follow news related to a specific topic.

2. www.socialmention.com

3. Google Suggest and Ubersuggest
Google Suggest is useful to find long-tail keyword ideas from searches. You will know what blogs to follow. This will help us come up with titles. Scan the article title results to find trends or topics to build upon. It is meant to help us brainstorm better titles.

## Content Optimisation ##

Use the checklist to review content before publishing:

1. Does this topic align with our content strategy? Will our readers/ personas care about it?
2. Is this the right format for the content?
3. Is the flow of the content logical? Are chapters/headers/points organized in an order that makes sense and naturally guides readers through the content?
4. Is the title compelling and interesting enough to get people to click through and read on?
5. Does the title accurately reflect the content within? Is it overly sensational or bombastic?
6. Are big chunks of text broken up with headers and paragraph breaks so it’s easier on the eyes and readers can scan and skim?
7. Are the headers interesting, compelling, and clear?
8. Are important points/stats/ideas called out in bold to catch readers’ attention?
9. Are images and visuals included where appropriate?
10. Is the writing interesting, entertaining, and easy to read?
11. Does the content tell a story? Is grammar correct?
12. Does the intro capture the reader’s attention? Is it interesting enough to get the reader to keep reading?
13. Does the content’s voice jibe with the overall voice of our content and company?
14. Did we use data, statistics, examples and quotations to back up our points?

16. Are statistics, data, quotes, ideas, etc. properly attributed to the source?
17. Are there internal links to other resources, landing pages, or blog articles?
18. Is the content spell-checked?
19. Does the content contain any sensitive or controversial information that we need to get anyone’s approval on before publishing? (e.g. our legal or PR department)
20. Have any stats cited or quotes used (etc.) been fact checked? Is the article well researched?
21. Could anything be potentially harmful to any of our partners, stakeholders, audience, or our company itself?
