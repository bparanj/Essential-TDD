# Usability Testing #

## Craigs List Ad  ##

The actual ad read :

We need a few people look at our Web site and give us some feedback. It's very easy, and would take about 45 minutes to an hour. You'll be paid $40 for your time. 

This approach is the best for observing the user and getting good feedback. For the first few rounds you can use face-to-face usability testing. Once you fix the major issues, you can use Amazon Mechanical Turk for much less money.

### Key Task Testing ###

Ask the user to do something, then watch how well they do. For instance:

1. Signup as affiliate
2. Signup as publisher. Setup your account.
3. Buy a Product using Paypal Account
4. Buy a Product using Guest Checkout
5. Get affiliate links to promote any product on your blog.

Take notes and note down the issues with the website.

## Amazon Mechanical Turk ##

### Home Page Tour ###

Go to www.clickplan.net and review the website. 

  1. What strikes you about this site?
  2. What can you do here?
  3. What is the purpose of this site?
  4. Who is it for?
  5. What is the value proposition?
  6. How is it organized?
  7. How it works

Describe in as much detail as you can the answers to the above questions. Your writing must be original and can not simply be a copy of part of the website. No award will be given for submissions of less than 50 words. Number your answers by its corresponding question.

I paid $2 per HIT and hired 5 people to test my site as well as two of my competitors sites. If you pay too low, the quality of submissions will be poor. I was able to approve 80% of the submissions. This approach is very effective.

## Online Website ##

I conducted the usability testing using usertesting.com. I paid $40 for a video that captured a user talking out aloud while using the website. It does help but using Amazon's Mechanical Turk is cheaper and you can get the same valuable feedback for cheap.
