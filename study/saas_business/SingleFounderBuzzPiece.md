## 7+1 Secrets to Single Founder Success

##### Secret 1 : Have a Higher Purpose

Having a higher purpose will give you the strength to overcome obstacles.

1. Are you building a business just to make money? 
2. What is the purpose of your existence? 
3. What is your contribution to the society?

##### Secret 2 : Play to Your Strengths

Do you have the opportunity to do what you do best every day? Know your strengths before you start your business.

1. Buy the 'Strengths Finder 2.0' book.
2. Take the 'Clifton Strengths Finder 2.0' assessment.
3. Print the personalized 'Strengths Insight Report'. Use the Action-Planning Guide to design your ideal business.

##### Secret 3 : Master Your Mindset

You will encounter obstacles. If you don't know how to handle them, then you have lost the battle even before you start.

1. Buy the 'The Wealthy Freelancer' book.
2. Read the chapter on Mindset Mastery and apply it.

##### Secret 4 : Focus on the Vital Few

Do you feel overwhelmed? Eliminate unnecessary tasks, delegate tasks that is not your strength and focus only on tasks that play to your strengths.

1. Buy the 'The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less' book.
2. Apply the principles to achieve more with less in every area of your life.  

##### Secret 5 : Build your Financial Intelligence

1. Buy the 'The Millionaire Fastlane'.
2. Apply the principles to unleash the millionaire entrepreneur in you. 

The Millionaire Fastlane is the best book about wealth. Period. It is even better than 'Think and Grow Rich'. 

##### Secret 6 : Participate in Master Mind Groups

1. Participate in forums, mailing lists, meetups in your area to share knowledge and learn.
2. Help others as much as you can. You will get help when you need it.

This makes up for the fact that you don't have a co-founder to discuss your problems. 

##### Secret 7 : Systems Thinking

Focus on growing your business. Do not work 'in' your business, work 'on' your business.

1. Buy the 'The E-Myth Revisited' book.
2. Apply the principles to build a system.

##### Secret 8 : Tie Everything Together

You can be a one-man army and build a successful business. Learn the simple time management system, strategic and tactical thinking and how to make your operations run smoothly.

1. Buy the 'Ultra Sales Machine' book.
2. Apply the 12 principles explained in that book to build your business.
