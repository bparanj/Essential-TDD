Understanding the Context of Experience

When designing an interaction, we need to know more than just what information to
display and collect.

We need to understand what people are trying to do, how they may try to do it,
and what might they interfere with, or facilitate, their actions.

For example, I might log in to my bank account at home on my laptop to check my
balance, to confirm that a transaction has posted, or I might log in while in line
at the grocery store to see if I have enough money in my account.

In both cases, I want to know my account balance, but I need that information
for different reasons, at different times and locations, by using different
devices, and with different urgency.

I can be more casual, and may seek additional details at home, but I'm likely to
be more focused on a single piece of information at the grocery store.
Retrieving the same piece of information -- my account balance -- may have different
design solutions once the designer understands the motivation for, and the context of, my behavior.

We use context scenarios to define the situation, the people, and their needs, so
that we can create interaction designs that will facilitate their behavior.
There are several questions we ask to help us create context scenarios.

What is the situation? 
What's the setting or environment in which the interface or the device will be used?
Is it public or private? 
Is it conducive?
Who will be using the device or interface?
Will it be used by one person, or multiple people?
If multiple people are using it, will it be shared, or will they take turns?
How long will the device or interface will be used?
Will it be for brief, moderate, or extended periods of time?
Will the person be able focus on their task, or will they be interrupted while using it?
Will they be interrupted rarely, occasionally, or frequently?
Does the experience need to be extremely simple? How much complexity can be accepted?
What are the person's needs and goals? What are they trying to accomplish or complete?
What's the expected outcome, or result, of using the device or interface?
What's the urgency of the goal or need?
Is it required immediately, or can it be done in a more relaxed and casual manner?

Only by understanding what people need and expect, and the circumstances under
which they will engage with the device or interface, can we design interactions
that will lead to success.

Understanding Need and Motivation

Motivation is the force that initiates, sustains, and directs behavior.
It drives everything we do, from eating, to social interactions, to creativity, and exploration.
We can better understand how a person might behave by understanding their
motivation, and what they need.

There are several ways we can describe motivation.
Sometimes people are motivated for external reasons, such as attention, fame, or
money, and sometimes people are motivated for internal reasons, such as
curiosity, competition, or being helpful.

When describing motivation this way, we often talk about the locus of control.
Intrinsic motivation is when behavior is driven by internal factors, and
people feel in control. They are doing something because they want to, and because it makes them feel good.

Extrinsic motivation is when behavior is influenced by external factors, such as
earning a salary, getting good grades, or receiving other, often tangible, rewards.
When people are intrinsically motivated, they feel focused, engaged, and interested.
When people are extrinsically motivated, they're more likely to lose interest in
the activity if the rewards or external factors are removed.

Some of the most successful experiences and interactions are those where people
are intrinsically motivated, because people really want to be engaged.
David McClelland describes motivation in terms of three needs: achievement,
affiliation, and power.

The need for achievement is characterized by the need to learn and solve problems.
The need for affiliation is characterized by our need for family and
social interactions.
The need for power is characterized by our drive for recognition and status.

These motives, or drives, influence our behavior, and different people have
different levels of each.

Some people are motivated more by social relationships, some by reaching
difficult goals, and some by persuading and influencing others.
Victor Vroom describes motivation in terms of three factors: expectancy,
instrumentality, and valence.

We can explain each of these as simple statements we might make to ourselves.
For expectancy, if I put forth the effort necessary, then I will perform well.
For instrumentality, if I perform well, then I will receive an outcome. And
for valence, if I value the outcome, then I will be motivated to put forth the effort necessary.
There will be little or no motivation if we expect to fail or perform poorly,
if there will be no outcome, or the outcome is not related to our effort, and if
we do not value the outcome, or the results.

People are more motivated, and will actually accelerate their behavior, as they
get closer and closer to their goals.

This is called the goal-gradient effect, and highlights the importance of helping
people understand their status and progress.

If we do not know how close we are to our goal, or if the endpoint keeps changing,
then our motivation may decrease.

We can help people feel like they're making progress by awarding points, or
showing the percentage of completion.

Membership programs and frequent buyer cards -- such as buy ten, get one free -- can
give people clear goals to work toward, and an easy way to track their progress.

Progress meters, such as file transfer status, or the percent complete of
an online profile, clearly communicate how much has been finished, and how much remains.
Remember, motivation may be lower at the start of a new goal, or just after
completing a goal, because we are far from completing our next goal.

To help people remain engaged, use personalized contact and encouragement,
help them define their next goal, and maybe even give them a break before helping
them start toward it.

There are many theories about motivation, and ways to describe it, but they all
provide a framework for understanding and describing what makes people interact,
what keeps them focused, and what keeps them going.

Understanding motivation helps us better define the context scenarios by helping
us understand the situation, the needs, the expectations, and the urgency.

Designing to Meet Needs

Context scenarios and motivation help us understand why people may interact, but
now we need to actually engage people, and we do this by establishing
credibility, and earning trust,
knowing when people need to interact across multiple devices and locations,
delivering what they need when they need it; making the experience only as
simple as it needs to be.

Credibility is essential for engaging people. If they believe that your device
or interface will benefit them, and that you will not deceive or take advantage
of them, then they're more likely to interact with it.

The key factors in establishing credibility on the Web,
are expertise, trustworthiness, and visual appeal, or visual quality.

Expertise can be established by offering accurate content, and relevant services.
Trust can be established by making it easy to contact you, keeping your content
current, and avoiding errors.

And visual quality can be established with a professional appearance, strong
usability, and accessibility.

People may not complete their interactions in a single visit or session, and
they may even have experiences that span multiple devices and locations.

eBook services are designed to allow people to seamlessly read their books
across multiple devices by remembering not only what ebooks they own, but which
page they were last reading, so that no matter when or where they open that book
again, it will be on the last page they viewed.

We can think about place shifting in terms of situation, attention, and urgency.
For the situation, what is the location and the conditions where someone is
interacting with the device or interface? Are they at home, in a private place, or
in a cafe, or other public place?

Will people be able to focus their attention? Are they multitasking, or likely to be distracted?
Do they need specific information urgently, or can they take the time to look
for deeper, more complete information?

People need different information and functionality at different times.
Traditionally, devices and interfaces have presented often complex and deep
menus at all times,
so that people could choose and specify what they want at any given time. But
this approach means that people need to stop and think about where they are,
what they're doing now, and what they want to do next, then look through a series
of menus lists, and options to find their choices, and decide which is the best
match for their next activity.

This interrupts their attention, their focus, and the flow of their interaction.
The effort put into thinking is called cognitive load, and we'll talk more about
that later in this course.

In most situations, there are only a few things that people are likely to
want or need to do next,
so it's not necessary to present all of the choices, all of the time.

Many devices and interactions avoid the effort necessary to craft
context-sensitive designs by shifting the decision-making back to the person, and this
increases their cognitive load.

It's easier to design a device or interface that forces people to specify what
they need than to design a device or interface that anticipates their needs, and
presents the appropriate choices,
but making people work harder to use a device or interface is not our goal.

For example, when I go to the ATM to make a deposit, I have to specify the
action, a deposit, the destination account, checking our savings,
and the type of deposit, I have a check, or multiple checks, or cash.
A smarter system wouldn't interrupt me with so many choices, and would
streamline my interaction.

I still need to dip my card, and log in, and I still need to specify that I want to
make a deposit, but we could use smart defaults based on my past behavior to
preselect my checking account if that's where I make most of my deposits, and
use design to make it easier to select a different account.

The bank could rely on the machine to identify multiple checks, and cash, and
we could use design to remind people, don't deposit coins.
I could complete my task in two fewer steps if the design of the experience were smarter.
Although we nearly always strive for simplicity in our designs, there are times
when we want to retain a bit of complexity in the experience.

We want to encourage people to take the time to think about their actions, to
help them better understand the information and process, and to reduce the
probability of errors.

This is not to say that we want to design intentionally complex experiences,
unless we're designing challenging games and puzzles, but sometimes
oversimplification can lead to more mistakes, and a poorer understanding of the
information and functionality.

When do we want to be careful about oversimplifying? When errors might be
serious, or difficult to undo, or when mistakes may go unnoticed.
We should be careful about using defaults, and designing an interaction that is
too smart, when it can lead to more errors, or a lack of understanding.
For example, online banks and brokerages need to ensure customers do not make
mistakes while managing their portfolios.

Every stock, bond, or mutual fund purchase is a multistep process, where the
investor must choose the position, specify the amount to purchase,
verify the position and the amount, and then submit the order.
There is no one click investment option, because a mistake might cost
significant amounts of money.
Banks and brokerages understand the value of information when making
investment choices,
so although the process could be made simpler, it's not in the best interest of the
investor to make it simpler, because mistakes and errors have a high cost.
By establishing trust, accommodating, place shifting, being context-sensitive,
and striving for simple, smart experiences, we can create interfaces and devices
that will truly meet people's needs, and minimize their effort.

Persuasive Design

Understanding context and what motivates people does not guarantee that
they will interact.

Sometimes a little persuasion can help get them started, and we can use what is
called persuasive design.

We can encourage people to interact with a device or interface by appealing
to their emotions, establishing trust, and incorporating these components of persuasion.

Reciprocity means that if people feel that your device or interface has done
something for them, they may return the favor by sharing, returning to the
site, registering, purchasing, or otherwise committing to future engagement and interaction.

People like to tell others about truly great experiences. People behave more
consistently and predictably when they have made a commitment to do something.
Sites that require people to identify themselves to make comments and contribute
content have fewer useless comments and flame wars.

Anonymity does not encourage commitment, but if people take the time to identify
themselves, and commit to worthwhile contributions, they're more likely to follow
through with positive comments.

People tend to conform, and we're often likely to do what everyone else is doing.
We observe what others are doing, then copy them.

Trends and fads influence the behavior of many people, which is why so many
people are interested in them.
People obey, follow, and believe authority figures.

When we are uncertain, we seek authorities to provide guidance, and
recommendations, and to serve as models.
Influential and respected people have many followers on social networks, because
they serve as models for them.

People are more likely to listen to, and believe, people they like, and with
whom they are similar, which is why our social networks are trusted sources of information.
Value and urgency increase as something becomes more scarce. If we believe
that many others may be interested in the same thing, then we're more likely
to make a choice, and act upon it, because competition increases the likelihood of behavior.

Limited availability, demand, and competition are powerful external motivators.
Remember that motivation is the force that initiates, directs, and sustains behavior.
These components of persuasion help engage people by enhancing motivation, and
they can make the difference when people are choosing to interact.
