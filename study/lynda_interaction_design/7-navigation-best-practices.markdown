Effective Navigation

This section is better viewed as video (assuming it has demo of the concepts)

Effective navigation, or moving around within a Web site, application, or game, is
essential for findability, and successful interactions.
The vast majority have much more content and functionality, spread across many pages.
People move among pages or screens three main ways: the navigational system, the
search system, and through contextual links in the body of the page.
All three of these must work together, and they all rely on having an effective
organizational system.
The most common way to represent the structure of a Web site is through a sitemap,
sometimes also called the site architecture.
This diagram shows how pages are organized in the overall hierarchical
structure of the site.
Although there are many ways to get to pages in a Web site, the sitemap only
illustrates the navigational paths among the pages.
Sitemaps do not show all of the possible links among all pages, because it would
become a very complex, and probably illegible, diagram if we tried to show that.
The sitemap is best for capturing the breadth, depth, and structure of the site.
But good structure and organization is more than just a sitemap.
We also need to deeply understand the content and information on the site,
and how it's organized.
Classifying and categorizing information has traditionally been a more
specialized information architecture task, and on very large Web sites, this is still the case.
Categorization is identifying the groups or categories of information, and
classification is assigning the information to the appropriate categories, and
then adding descriptive details.
We use what is called a taxonomy to record the hierarchical categories.
A great example comes from biology, where we all learn how to sort living things
into kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.
Just as every creature on earth can be classified with this system, all
information on a Web site can be classified into structured categories,
and we represent that information structure with a taxonomy.
For example, when shopping for shoes, there is a hierarchical structure to the
information, and this is reflected in both the sitemap, and the navigation of the Web site.
From the homepage of the store, we can choose Shoes, Men's, Athletic, Running,
and we see an assortment of shoes from which to select.
This is a taxonomic system for shoes.
Additional descriptive details, called metadata, can help us find what we
want more effectively.
These details are actually not part of the hierarchical categories, but they are
important for helping us navigate and search more effectively.
Metadata include tags, labels, descriptors, and attributes.
These additional data help us narrow down large sets of information to smaller
sets that are more relevant.
For example, once I have arrived at men's running shoes, I may be faced with
hundreds or thousands of choices.
How will I find the best pair of shoes for me?
I can narrow down my choices with filters, such as size, color, brand, weight, and price.
Thousands of possible shoes can be quickly reduced to just a dozen or two, which
is much easier for me to review,
and I know that I am more likely to find something that matches what I need.
The navigational system of a Web site or application, and the ability to
search, are global features; they're always present and available, no matter
where we are on the site.
Contextual links vary from page to page, but they are always identifiable, even
though they usually appear within the content and functionality.
Although the appearance of the navigation system and contextual links may
differ, there are some underlying techniques to ensure they are findable,
usable, and effective.
The navigation system itself is placed in a location on the site that is stable
and consistent throughout.
We often see navigation bars running horizontally across the page in the header,
or a navigation column running vertically down the left side.
But on mobile sites, the navigation may be rolled up into a menu button, or placed
at the bottom of the page, below the content.
Where we choose to place the navigation, and how much we choose to make visible,
depends on the depth and complexity of the site,
the expertise of the people using it, and the device on which it is most often viewed.
We use a horizontal navigation bar when a large number of categories is unlikely,
and when the persistent visibility of the navigation is helpful to people.
Horizontal navigation is constrained by the width of the screen on which it is
viewed, and they often have drawers or dropdowns that open to expose the lower
levels of navigation.
We use a vertical navigation column when there may be a large number of
categories, and when being able to see the navigational hierarchy is helpful.
Vertical navigation can include and show many categories, but a long list
may disappear below the bottom edge of the browser window, which we call
falling below the fold.
Vertical navigation often opens up like a file tree to expose the lower
levels of navigation.
We may also collapse the navigation into a menu that must be opened with a click or tap.
We do this for small screens with limited space, or when people are experts
with the site, and do not need the navigation visible at all times in order to be efficient.
Navigation systems can be complex, and we often see hybrids that combine both
horizontal and vertical location, but all navigation should help people
understand where they are, where they can go, and the organizational
structure of the site.
The most common way to present contextual links in the body of a page or screen
is with text links, buttons, and tabs.
Test links were traditionally blue and underlined, and in the early days of the
Internet, people were explicitly instructed to click here, to teach them how to use links.
Now people understand text links, and they have learned that just about any
text that looks different from the text around it may be a link.
We no longer need to adhere to the blue and underlined rule of the early
days, but we still need to ensure that text links are distinct from the
surrounding content.
Buttons and tabs are common graphical links, and they should have hover, or over,
and down, or pushed, states to provide feedback when they are clicked or tapped.
We will go into this in more detail later.
When content is presented as a sequence of pages or screens, such as a photo
gallery, or a set of product reviews, we often navigate through them using both
an index page, and with next and previous buttons, or pagination controls.
The index page uses links to jump directly to any page or screen. For example, a
grid of images lets us choose which image we want to view, and a list of
articles lets us choose which we want to read first.
We don't have to start at the first item in the list.
Next and previous buttons are also contextual links that help us move forward or
backward, one item or page at a time.
These buttons may be placed near the relevant content to make it clear what will be changing.
For many years in Web design, new content was simply added to the bottom of an
existing page or list,
so we thought of the top as being the oldest, and the bottom as the most recent,
such as comments on blogs.
But social networking sites have changed our expectations of time when
information is presented vertically, because the newest posts and comments
appear at the top, and the older content is lower on the page.
We still see both of these arrangements in use today, so make certain you
understand the expectations of your audience when you choose where to put
the newest content.
One of the most common concerns about the navigation system is depth.
Site owners often ask, how deep is this site? How many clicks or taps does it
take to get somewhere?
You may hear generalized statements, such as, more than three clicks is too
many, but rather than concern ourselves with counting clicks or taps, we should
focus on the person's perception of progress.
In other words, if every click or tap makes sense, feels like it moves the
person closer to their goal, and if they never ask, why am I not there yet?
Then the site is not too deep.
If it takes eight clicks or taps to get somewhere, and every click or tap felt right
to the person, then it's okay.
However, when people start asking, am I there yet?
How much farther? And why is this taking so long?
Then there is probably a problem with the depth and organization of the site, or
the sequence of steps to complete a task.
An organized navigation system helps people find what they need. As long as we
feel like we're moving forward toward our goal, and each click or tap makes
sense, then the structure and depth is good.

Searching and Filtering

This section is better viewed as video (assuming it has demo of the concepts)

Although navigation is visible, and persistently available, search is also important.
Search is an expected feature of nearly all Web sites and applications.
People have been trained by search engines to expect to be able to find and jump
directly to the information they need.
Poor search experiences are just as likely to lead to abandonment as poor
navigational systems.
Keyword search is the most common type;
we only need to enter the important or keywords to get a set of matching results.
However, natural language search is becoming more common, especially as more
people use voice recognition.
Natural language search allows people to speak or type in sentences, the same
way they would speak to other people,
and the search system processes that search request for meaning, identifies the
keywords, and returns relevant results.
For traditional keyword search to find the capital of France, we might just
enter capital France,
but for natural language search, we might speak, what is the capital of France?
Both of those search queries would return Paris as the answer.
Natural language search feels more, well, natural to use,
but it requires more computing power to identify the keywords in the context
of the search query.
This is a great example of designing smarter experiences that make the computer
do all the work, rather than pushing the cognitive effort back on the person, and
making them decide, what are the most important keywords?
Search can also make real-time recommendations, suggestions, and matches based on
what we are typing into the search box.
Using the partial keyword entry, context, and even past searching behavior, the
search engines can identify likely matches, and present them as we type.
It is even possible to present the suggestions not just as a list of likely
matches, but in groups that reflect the taxonomy, metadata, and even social
sharing patterns of the information being searched.
For example, on radio, in my account, I have the artist Annie Lennox,
so when I began typing Annie, the top hit is an artist the system knows I
like: Annie Lennox.
But it also suggests other artists named Annie, albums, and songs with Annie in
the title, playlists that have been named Annie, and even users named Annie.
Search queries often return too many matching results, so we need a way to
narrow down and arrange the results into a more manageable set.
We use sorting to rearrange the list into different sequences, such as
alphabetical, newest to oldest; lowest to highest price.
Sorting does not reduce the size of the list; it just reorders it.
We use filtering to reduce the number of matching results in the list, such as
choosing to see only shirts that are large, blue, and made of cotton.
When we reduce the size of a set of search results, we are doing what is called winnowing;
we are removing the information that does not match what we need.
Although we may change the keywords to be more specific, we often rely on the filters.
Most people find it easier to narrow down a large set of results with filters,
than to think of more effective keywords.
However, filters may actually work two different ways. Subtractive filters
always reduce the size of the result set.
Additive filters sometimes increase the size of the result set.
Let's take a look at a few examples.
If I go shopping on the Kohl's site for men's shirts, you can see that there are
more than a thousand matches, but I'm interested in large shirts that are blue,
so I begin to filter.
When I add the large filter, you can see that the matching set reduces to just over 600,
and when I add the color blue, that set gets smaller again; now only 238 matches.
This is subtractive filtering, because the list is getting smaller.
Now let's take a look at additive filtering.
If I am shopping on Zappos for men's shirts, you can see there's more than
6000 matching items,
but as I begin to add filters, once again that set gets smaller.
When I add the size large, now there is only 3900 matches, and if I add the color
blue, we will see that it gets smaller yet again.
Now, large and blue, there are 555 matching shirts, but if I decide that I think
may be medium or large is my size, I can add the size medium to the query.
Now that number has gone up to 674, because I'm seeing shirts that are large,
and medium, and blue.
People often cannot accurately predict how filters will work, but once they
begin interacting with them, they quickly learn and understand, because the
matching results provide effective feedback.
We also need to think about how we are going to present the search results.
Different types of information can be presented more effectively with different layouts.
News and information sites typically show their search results as a list of
matching pages or articles.
Shopping and photography sites show their search results as a grid of images.
Airline and travel sites show their search results as tables, where each row is
a match, and each column contains different relevant information.
Search engines often display matching results in different or hybrid formats
based on the information.
We may see matching images included in a list, preview images of Web sites, and
tabular data for detailed information.
Search results are often a very large set of information, even after being
filtered and sorted,
so we need a clear and simple way to show the results in manageable sets.
We also need to consider bandwidth or connection speed, because people on slow
connections do not want to wait for everything to load,
so we should show the results in smaller sets.
Pagination is the most common solution;
we present a specific number of results per page, and allow people to easily
move from page to page.
We might also give them the ability to change the number of results per page, or
even the option to view all if they want.
Pagination controls should always indicate the page you're currently on, the
total number of pages, and have the ability to go to the next or previous page.
We also typically show at least a limited range of numbers on either side of the current page.
A more recent design pattern for displaying large sets of information is
called infinite scrolling. Let's take a look.
On this site, when it first loads, it preloads a few screens of information,
but as I scroll down -- watch the scroll bar on the right hand side -- and I approach
the bottom of the content that was initially loaded, you can see the Web site
loads more, and the page just gets longer.
I never quite reach the bottom of the page, but as I approach it, the Web site
loads more, and it gets longer.
This is infinite scrolling.
The site manages bandwidth requirements by only loading more information as we
approach the end of the current set.
If we do not scroll down, then no more information is loaded.
An alternate form of infinite scrolling does not load more information
automatically; it waits for people to reach the bottom of the page, gives them
the option to load more, which then makes the page longer.
Two important topics when discussing search are search engine optimization, SEO,
and search engine marketing, SEM.
SEO focuses on improving the rank and placement of a Web site in the search
results for natural or organic search based on keywords, not paid advertising and placement.
SEM focuses on improving the rank and placement of a Web site in the search
results by a paid placement, and advertising.
This is a deep and complex field beyond our discussion here today, but if you're
interested in SEO, there is more information available here on Lynda.com.
Many people arrive at Web pages via search, which means that they may not have
started on the homepage, and navigated in more deeply.
This is why it's essential that a site's navigational system be clear,
meaningful, and predictive.
If people start at the middle, they need to be able to identify where they are,
and where they can go from here.
More about this in a moment, when we discuss having a sense of place.

Contextual Relevance

The traditional approach to navigation has been to help people locate and go to
the information or functionality they need, through a series of steps or pages,
much like a dictionary or telephone book.
We flip through the pages arranged by the structure of the information until we
get to the content we seek.
Search has changed the way we find information; now we tell a Web site or
application what we want, and it brings the content to us.
Links operate parallel to the navigation and search, and they connect
related pieces of content.
They are direct paths based on relevance and meaningfulness.
The original concept of the hyperlink was that all information could be
interconnected to all other related information.
This is still how we browse.
But when we know what we need, we don't want to browse or navigate along long
paths to get to it; we want shortcuts, or better yet, we want the Web site or
application to make that information available to us right where we are.
There are three ways that Web sites and applications can provide people with
contextually relevant content at the moment they need it.
Shortcut links go directly to another related page.
Contextual menus, accessed with a click or tap, present options relevant to the
information selected.
Dynamic layers deliver content or functionality above the current page, and can
be easily closed when we're finished.
For example, a calculator tool can be accessed when needed on a banking Web site.
Although we've had layers of information for decades, they haven't always been effective.
Remember when we might have dozens of separate browser windows open at the
same time, and pop-up ads that couldn't be closed fast enough? All of these
early terrible experiences taught people to avoid layers of content in multiple windows.
A few years ago, our Web browsers gave us tabs instead of multiple windows, and
made it possible to display content that appears above the Web page, but is
actually still part of the page.
We've become more familiar and comfortable with layers of information, and they
are now being used more effectively.
We no longer think only about moving forward and going back on Web sites; we also
think about moving up and down through layers or stacks of information.
It doesn't confuse us to have new layers appear on top of our current layer. We
know we can close the layer, or move it out of the way to go back down to where
we were. Down is the new back.
When using layers, we don't always cover all of the underlying page. We often
allow some of the information underneath to peek out and remain visible, as a
reminder of where the person was when the layer appeared, and where they'll
return when the layer is closed.
There are a few key considerations to ensure that the design maintains
context for the person.
Can the layer be dragged around to expose different parts of the underlying page or screen?
Sometimes people need to be able to see information from the underlying page
in order to complete a task in a layer, so being able to move the layer can be helpful.
Is it clear how to close and exit the layer?
There should be clear icons and links for closing, and often people can simply
click or tap outside of the layer to close it.
Will there be an obfuscation layer? That is, a semitransparent layer that
partially conceals the underlying page.
We use obfuscation layers when we want people to be focused on the content layer,
and when they do not need to see the information below it, yet we still want to
maintain the context of the original page.
If done correctly, multiple layers can be stacked;
it just needs to make sense to us.
We need to maintain context, and have a clear way of understanding that the top
layer is associated with the content and functionality below it, that there is a
way to close the current layer to go back, and there is a way to move the layer
aside if we need to refer to the information below it.
Let's take a look at how multiple layers can work.
On my Google+ account, in my photo albums, at the lowest level, you see the
images, but when I mouse over one, it expands in a content layer to show me a
full preview of that image. And when I select it, it loads it into a layer
above my photo album to show me the image, and the comments that are
associated with it.
And if I choose to edit this photo, I can open the creative Kit, and it starts
another layer on top of the original comments and photo layer.
And now, at this point, I'm actually three layers deep in content: the editing
layer, the photo and comments layer, and the original photo album layer beneath it all.
When using layers,
make certain that all of the information and functionality is presented in that layer.
We would not rely on people remembering information from one page to another, so
we should not rely on them remembering information from one layer to another.
We should be looking for ways to design smarter interactive experiences.
Stop the scavenger hunt.
Don't force people to go looking for what they need.
Instead, design Web sites and applications that bring content and functionality
to the person when they need it, such as using layers.
Allow them to interact with it, where they are, rather than forcing them to
leave where they are, and what they're doing, and navigate somewhere else, only
to return to this place when they're finished.

Sense of Place

As we discuss navigation, we stress the importance of context, and knowing
where we are in a Web site or application.
When we move through a site or application, we develop a sense of place.
We know where we are, how we got there, and we have expectations about where we can go.
We even develop a mental model of the overall structure and organization of
the site in our minds.
It's like building a sitemap in our heads by using our experience.
This ability to develop a sense of place, and to predict where we might find
things, is called the scent of information, and it is based on the research of
Peter Pirolli, who studied information foraging theory.
Essentially, we identify a trail of information. One piece leads to another,
through meaningful connections, and when that trail is broken through a bad
link, inaccurate search, or poor navigation, we need to go back, pick up the
trail, and start again.
But when we have good context and meaning, and a strong sense of place, people do
not need to go back and start over.
When we see people going back again and again, we know that we have a poor scent
of information, and the opportunity to make it better.
We can establish context and a sense of place with just a few simple techniques.
First, use the navigation system itself as an indicator to show the location.
Highlight the labels that led to the current page.
People can look at the navigation to identify their section.
Second, breadcrumbs, often placed just below the navigation, show the specific path
in the site map that leads to the current page, and each entry in the breadcrumb
is a shortcut link to that hierarchically higher page.
Third, page headers, subheaders, and content cues, such as bullet lists, and
images, help identify the current location.
Although the content of the current page or screen may not reveal the actual
location in the sitemap, the content can help clarify the relationship with
prior pages or screens.
And on a more technical note, even the address, or URL, of the page can help
communicate a sense of place for some people.
Human readable URLs often expose the structure of the sitemap, so savvy
people who lose their sense of place may be able to look at the URL to gain a
better understanding.
We can often determine if a person has a good sense of place on a Web site or
application by observing their navigational behavior.
If they make relatively quick, deliberate navigational choices, and they rarely
back up, then the system is communicating where they are, and setting appropriate
expectations about where each link, button, icon, or tab will take them when
they click or tap on it.
If a person frequently uses the Back button, and returns to a page or screen
repeatedly, or if they appear to randomly choose links in a trial and error
fashion, then they do not have a strong sense of place.
People often go back multiple steps, or they go to the homepage or a landing page,
in order to find a recognizable or familiar place.
They reorient themselves, then navigate more deeply again, often on a different path.
Since they do not know where they are, they go back until they do.
When people seem to be choosing links randomly, or are clicking systematically on
every link in a regular pattern, they don't know where they are, and they're
simply clicking links to see where they might lead.
This is not casual browsing; this is a person who has given up on having a
meaningful experience, and is now simply hoping that they'll stumble into
something recognizable, meaningful, or useful.
As we mentioned just a few minutes ago, many people arrive at a Web site via a
search engine, and they land somewhere deep within the site,
so it's essential that they are able to quickly identify where they are, and why
this location is relevant.
In fact, one way to test the accuracy and relevance of a navigational system
is to simply drop someone onto a random page in the site or application, and
ask, where are you?
How do you think you might have gotten or navigated here, if you had started on the homepage?
Where do you think you can go, or navigate to, from here?
If people are able to accurately answer all three questions, then your
navigational system and all of its cues have contributed to a strong scent of information.
When people have a strong sense of place, they are more likely to complete their
task, and have a positive experience.
