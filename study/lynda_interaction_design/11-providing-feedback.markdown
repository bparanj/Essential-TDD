Defining Feedback for Interaction Design

Feedback is the information we get about the results of our actions.
It helps us understand if we are progressing toward our goal,
if there have been any errors, where we are, and how to modify our future
behavior to keep ourselves on track.
Feedback may be obvious and attention grabbing, such as warning messages that
cover the entire screen, or it may be subtle and nuanced, such as background color, or
icons to communicate status.
Feedback is actually a way to provide either reinforcement, keep doing that, or
discouragement, stop doing that. It's essential to helping people understand
the results of their actions, as well as helping them learn new interactions.
Feedback provides information about place, to help us understand where we are;
time, to help us understand what is currently happening, and what will or may happen;
meaning, to help us understand the results or outcomes of our actions, and it
helps us to establish context.
We'll discuss each of these more in depth soon, but here's a quick introduction.
Just as landmarks and signs give us a sense of place in the physical world,
feedback and content cues give us a sense of place in the digital world.
There is a scent of information that helps us establish a trail back to where
we've been, and points us forward to where we may go.
In the midst of interacting, we seek feedback about our progress, and what
our devices are doing.
It helps answer common questions, like, should I wait a little longer? Am I almost
finished? What's going to happen next?
When we've completed an action, we want to know if we have been successful; is
the outcome what we expected?
We look for connections between what we did, and the results.
Feedback also helps decide if the outcomes are valuable, or worthwhile.
Desirable and expected results increase the likelihood that we will perform
those actions again in the future.
We learn new behaviors when the results of our actions are rewarding, and benefit us.
On the other hand, if the outcomes are undesirable, unexpected, or incorrect, then
these negative results decrease the likelihood that we will perform those
actions again in the future.
We learn to stop, or avoid behaviors when the results of our actions cost us time and effort.
Interaction design is a bit like physics:
for every action, there should be a reaction.
For most interactions, there should be some form of feedback: a noticeable and
understandable reaction from the interface or device.
We need to design ways to meaningfully acknowledge interactions.
Failing to acknowledge an interaction can lead to unnecessary repetition of
actions, and possibly even errors or mistakes.
For feedback to be effective, it must be prompt, meaningful, and perceivable.
We need to present feedback soon after the interaction has occurred, otherwise
people will think their actions were not detected.
Feedback must be meaningfully related to a person's actions, otherwise they may
not understand why the interaction produced the results.
And we need to draw or direct attention to the feedback, because people may not
be focused on the interface, or the device, at the time feedback is presented.
Finally, feedback should not interrupt the person's experience unless it is
necessary to prevent errors.
Feedback should complement the experience, not complicate it.

Deciding on a Feedback Format

Feedback that's not noticed is not useful.
We need to deliver feedback in a manner that's both noticeable, and in
the appropriate format.
The vast majority of interfaces provide feedback visually, but we can also use
sound, and tactile, or haptic, feedback.
Location is important for visual feedback.
We can get attention more quickly by placing feedback where the person
is already looking.
Remember, we are sensitive to change, and to certain colors, so presenting
feedback in a layer with strong visual cues can easily attract attention.
Color, icons, motion, and text can all be used to provide feedback visually, and
this feedback may be direct, such as a message, ambient, such as color, or both.
For example, a confirmation message that profile information has been
updated uses all three.
When Save is clicked, a new message appears near the top of the page.
It has a different fill color to draw attention, and green communicates success.
It contains an icon that illustrates success, a brief text message explains what
was completed, and the entire message area may be timed to fade and collapse
after a specific interval, to reduce interference.
As we design for an increasing number of touchscreens, our fingers become an
important way of receiving feedback.
Vibration is the most common form of tactile, or haptic, feedback.
Our mobile phones have been vibrating for years to alert us to phone calls, text
messages, and status updates, but they also use vibration to provide feedback
when typing, and pressing buttons.
Another type of tactile feedback is force feedback, though we probably only
encounter this with games, and training simulators.
Force feedback is when a device or controller provides resistance to our
actions, and that resistance can vary in intensity.
For example, if a lever would be difficult to move in real life, then the
joystick or lever controller in the game or simulator would also be difficult to move.
This type of feedback is usually tied to real world physics, so it provides
realistic feedback about how much effort we should expand.
Sound can also be used to provide feedback. Beeps and bells often tell us that
we need to pay attention to something, or that a process has started, ended, or
encountered an error.
Simple auditory feedback is used to acknowledge button presses and taps on
touchscreens and kiosks.
These sounds are often brief and subtle. They barely attract our attention, yet
they provide important information.
We can even mark progress with sound. The ticking of a mechanical timer tells us
that the cake is still baking.
Then it buzzes when the cake is finished.
Elevators beep as they pass each floor, then they make a different sound when
they arrive, and the doors open.
Auditory feedback can be important when designing for accessibility;
when sound must supplement what would typically be only a visual feedback.
The sound itself may also convey meaning.
Happy sounds indicate success, but unpleasant sounds indicate problems, or failure.
Part of the positive or negative meaning of the sound comes from the quality or
timbre of the sound itself.
Irritating noises are naturally unpleasant and negative, like the wrong answer
sound on game shows, but part of the meaning we attribute to sound comes from
experience and learning.
Desktop operating systems expose people to subtle sound cues and feedback every day.
We learn what those sounds mean, and often we learn the meaning so well that we
do not even need to look at the accompanying text message.
And of course, games rely extensively on sound to add excitement and interest, as
well as provide feedback about the game play.
The topic of sound design is becoming increasingly important as our devices do
more and more for us.
One of the most challenging aspects of providing feedback is that touchscreen
gestures and spatial gestures leave no trace.
Once we have touched or gestured, it's up to us to remember what we did.
Accidental touches and gestures may cause changes in the device or interface, and
we may not know how or why it happened.
The change is feedback that an interaction was processed and completed, but
if the touch or gesture was unintentional, people may not know how to undo or repeat it.
How do we tell people what they did?
When typing, I see the letters appear for each keypress.
When dragging, I see the new position of the object, but with many multitouch
or spatial gestures, there is no visible or remaining record of my interactions.
These are interaction design challenges we still face.
Not only how to communicate which gestures will cause what actions before the
interaction occurs, but how to represent which gestures were performed after the
interaction occurred.
One possible approach is to use overlays and animation to visually represent the gestures.
Applications for touchscreen devices often use an overlay when teaching people
how to use an application, and communicating which gestures are available.
Feedback comes in many formats, and even subtle or ambient information is
valuable to meaningful interactions, as long as it's prompt and relevant.

Place, Time and Meaning

Some feedback is vitally important, like the warning that you're about to delete
your entire music collection, or transfer all of your money out of your bank
account, but most feedback is casually informative.
It's simply keeping us aware of our place, and time, our progress, and helping us
understand our context.
We previously discussed effective navigation, and many of the techniques we
described are based on delivering relevant and timely feedback to help
establish a sense of place.
One important, but often overlooked aspect of feedback for navigation are the
active, hover, visited, down, and disabled states.
These quickly and efficiently communicate both the opportunity for interaction,
as well as confirmation of the action.
The active state is the appearance of a link, button, tab, or icon before we
interact with it; its appearance must communicate the opportunity to interact.
The hover state changes appearance when we approach the element.
The down state acknowledges that our click or tap was received.
The visited state serves as a visual reminder that we have interacted with this
element already, and the disabled state communicates that the interaction is not
currently available, so that we avoid an interaction that will have no result.
When people are engaged in interacting with a process or application, they
want to know its status.
Is it ready for me to interact?
Graphics, text, and motion can easily communicate readiness, such as a blinking
cursor, or a microphone icon labeled with, speak now.
Is the process still going?
Progress bars, spinning graphics, and text labels communicate progress.
Has it frozen, or crashed?
Should I be patient and wait, or worry and panic?
The absence of motion, or prolonged waiting with no visible progress,
typically causes concern.
If a process will take a long time, that is, longer than people might expect, then
warn them in advance, with an estimate of the amount of time.
Has it finished? Can I continue?
Confirmation messages, updated information, and returning the interface to a state
of readiness for interaction, all signal that the process is complete, and the
interface is ready to proceed.
For some processes, we're able to calculate, or at least estimate, the time it
will take, so we're able to communicate the progress, and time remaining,
relatively accurately.
For example, if we know the amount of data, and the transfer rate, we can provide
an informative estimate of the time to complete the transfer, or the percent of
the transfer that's complete.
For these processes where we know time and amount, we should display a visual
indicator of progress, and information about the process, such as percent
complete or remaining.
However, some processes are indefinite; we're not able to accurately estimate
how long it will take, or how much has been completed.
When we are unable to estimate duration, or communicate specific progress, we need
to clearly communicate that the process is still active, and underway.
For indefinite processes, we are often only able to show a repeating
animation, and a message, such as a spinning indicator, with please wait while
we complete your request;
this may take a few moments.
If it's possible to estimate the average range of time to complete a process,
then include this information, so that people will know what to expect.
Provide the ability to cancel a process without cost or lost whenever possible.
Having an option to stop and recover can be reassuring if people know they have
a way to try again safely.
For long or complex tasks, indicate the successful completion of each step.
In most cases, we simply need to acknowledge that the step has been completed, and
not interfere with proceeding efficiently.
We use inline messages, placed where people will see them; color, motion, and
fading in and out can all direct and focus attention on the subtle feedback.
However, sometimes we need the person to acknowledge the completion of an
individual step, so we give them an informative message, and wait for them to
dismiss it, or to act and move on to the next step.
This may be important for unfamiliar or difficult tasks to help people
understand what's been done, and why.
This type of interim status message can also be used to reduce errors, such as
the confirmation requests for actions that may be difficult to undo or correct.
For example, are you sure you want to remove all eBooks from your Kindle? As with
all feedback, it's really only useful when people notice it, and understand it.
So don't hide confirmation messages behind clicks or taps, and don't remove them
automatically without sufficient time for people to notice, and read them.
When a process is complete, people expect a confirmation message, or action.
It may be either a success, or a failure. Simply allowing a progress indicator to
disappear may not be sufficient.
Failures, or errors, often mean that the person needs to make a correction, and try again.
We'll talk more about error handling, and error messages in a moment, because
they are very important to eventual success.

Error Handling and Messages

We may not always understand why we get a desirable outcome; we're just happy
with the positive results, but when something goes wrong, we are eager to know
what happened, why it happened, and what to do about it.
Error messages are a particularly important type of feedback, because they help
us understand what went wrong, and how to improve our actions in the future.
Error messages can also be difficult to design well.
When errors occur, people become frustrated, and this interferes with their
ability to focus on, understand, and resolve the problem.
The best type of error handling is error prevention.
If we can design to prevent errors, then we have a better design.
However, no device or interface is perfect, so we still need to design effective
feedback for those times when something fails.
Let's start with the error message itself.
Effective error messages have four characteristics.
Use natural language, and never blame the person. Clearly describe what went
wrong. Briefly explain why it went wrong, and recommend how to fix or resolve the error.
Place error messages as near the error as possible.
Many sites and applications use two types of error message: a generic message
that errors have occurred, often placed near the top of the page or browser, and a
specific message near the error itself.
Use color, such as yellow, orange, or red, to draw attention, and indicate urgency.
Subtle transitions, such as a fade, or changing the color from yellow to green, can
be used to remove error messages after a correction has been made.
Provide error messages as soon as possible.
It's a better experience to correct an error immediately after it's occurred, and
it's also easier to understand the error if it's caught right away.
Form fields and inputs may be validated or checked for errors on a per field, or per page, basis.
Validation per field means that each form field or input is checked for errors
as soon as information is entered.
This is more immediate,
will only display one error at a time, and allows people to correct errors
before they proceed too far.
Validation per page means that multiple form fields are checked for errors only
when the entire set is complete.
This is less immediate, may display more than one error at a time, and may occur
only after people have entered a lot of information.
If there are multiple errors on a page, display them all, and allow people to
make multiple corrections at once.
It is a bad experience to display one error at a time when there are multiple
errors on a page, because people will be returned to the same page repeatedly
until all the errors have been fixed.
This is frustrating, and often causes confusion.
We also need to make a distinction between errors and mistakes.
An error occurs when an action or process cannot be completed correctly, such as
the inability to complete a transaction, because the credit card number was
entered incorrectly.
A mistake is an incorrect choice, or information that does not prevent the
action or process from being completed, but the end result is not anticipated, or desired.
For example, I may have intended to transfer $100 from my savings to my checking
account, but I typed 1000.
If my savings account has $1000 in it, then no error will occur.
I'll have made a mistake, but the transfer will happen.
Feedback should confirm the interaction, and the outcome, and when
interactions are important, such as transferring money from your bank
account, the action should be verified, and we should have the opportunity to
correct or undo mistakes.
When we make an error or mistake, the ability to undo can be very important.
We may not understand why the mistake occurred, and we may simply want to go back
to where we were, and try again.
Remember, the best type of error handling is preventing errors in the first
place, but errors do happen sometimes, so it's important to help people
understand what happened, and how to fix it, without causing worry or frustration.

Feedback Cycle

Feedback is a key component of the principles of interaction design, because
it's central to how we gain experience, and learn from our interactions.
Our interactions should lead to perceivable, noticeable feedback, and when we
understand it, we learn from it.
We use this information to learn, and practice, and get better, and we take what we
learn, and apply it in other situations, for other interfaces and devices.
The cycle continues, and before long, we have learned behaviors, and acquired
expectations about how to interact with the digital world.
Feedback provides information that helps us understand our experiences.
It provides reinforcement that strengthens learning, and shapes our behavior.
It motivates us to keep interacting, keep trying, and keep seeking new and
different experiences, and it can even lead to moments of surprise and delight
that bring us pleasure, and a sense of fun and play with unexpected successes, or
confirmation of achievement.

Conclusion

We've covered many topics, and seen many examples in this course, but there is
still so much more we can discuss.
Interaction design is an ever changing field.
Devices, technology, and expectations evolve, and there will always be a need to
craft new interactions, and create new solutions, and best practices.
Even though our designs may change, and technology advances, our brains still
think, process, and remember information the same way.
We learn new behaviors, and we have new expectations, but we can still rely on
the five principles of interaction design to help us craft better designs, and
solutions that make it easy for people to interact with interfaces and devices,
no matter how complex the technology may become.
Remember, these five essential principles all work together in a system.
When we perceive the opportunity to interact, and predict that the outcome is
desirable, we will interact.
Meaningful feedback helps us understand and learn from our actions.
As we practice and observe, our understanding grows.
When we encounter similar consistent interfaces and devices, we are able to
transfer what we have learned, and interact more easily.
If we understand how people think, what they need and expect, how they learn and
remember, what motivates them, and how they react and feel, then we can identify
and deliver effective solutions.
We still need to remain current and knowledgeable about technology and design
practices, so stay connected and active in the interaction design community.
Keep your skills polished and honed with books, videos, tutorials, seminars,
conferences, and memberships in professional organizations. And remember,
interaction design is not about the behavior of the interface; it's about
the behavior of people.
