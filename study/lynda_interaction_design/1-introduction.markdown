# Introduction #
## Welcome ##

In this course, we are going to explore the essential principles and best practices for designing better and more effective interactions for nearly any interface or device. We will start by taking a glimpse back at the origins of interaction design, and move to the present day, with an introduction to the tools and techniques used by today's interaction designers. 

From there, we'll build a foundation with the five essential principles of interaction design, and get a better understanding of how people perceive, process, understand, learn, and remember information in digital environments.

People's needs and expectations strongly influence their behaviors when interacting with devices, so we'll explore how to create successful designs, while keeping motivation and context in mind. We'll talk about how the structure and organization of content and functionality facilitates interaction, discuss how our sensory systems influence our perceptions, and how we can craft designs to help guide attention, and enhance memory. And through it all, we will show examples, and offer explanations of how to apply this information to your own design methods and techniques.

## Who is this course for? ##

It's for students, designers, and developers. Anyone who wants to better understand how people think, why we behave the way we do, and how to create interfaces that meet our needs more effectively.

This is not a course that teaches how to create design documents, like wireframes, icons, and infographics, or how to use design software. This course focuses on how to approach interaction design, better understand how people think, and how to make better interaction design decisions.

We will ask questions, discuss design principles, and show how to create more
effective, and more considerate interfaces and devices. We will discuss interactivity from multiple perspectives, but nearly all of it will be in the context of psychology, to help us better understand how people think, and act, so that our designs truly work well, and meet their needs.

Although interaction designers define the structure and behavior of interactive
systems and devices, we should not focus solely on the interface. Interaction design is really about the behavior of people. Too many of the devices, software, and tools we use complicate, obstruct, or delay our tasks, and in some cases, even thwart our efforts completely.

We should strive to craft interfaces, systems, and devices that enhance
our productivity, facilitate our actions, meet our needs, create value, and
even provide enjoyment.
