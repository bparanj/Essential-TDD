# Five Essential Principles of Interaction Design #
## Consistency ##

There are many topics we could include in discussions of interaction design, from mental models, to the sent of information, to direct action. If we're going to establish a foundation for solid interaction design practices, we need to focus on a few core principles that can be used inform and guide nearly all of our design decisions.

These five essential principles of interaction design, consistency, perceivability, learnability, predictability, and feedback, help focus us on crafting better solutions, experiences, and designs. Let's take a deeper look at
each of these principles, starting with consistency.

We are wired to be sensitive to change. Changes attract our attention. Think about camouflage; as long as the person or animal remains still, we cannot see them, but as soon as they move, and their appearance changes relative to their surroundings, their presence becomes obvious.

The same thing can happen across the pages or screens of a digital experience. As long as persistent elements remain in the same place, retain the same appearance, and adhere to the same grid layout and proportions, we do not direct attention toward them until we need them. But when elements move and change appearance without purpose across pages or screens, it becomes immediately noticeable.

Consistency applies not only to appearance and placement, but also to behavior. When a feature behaves differently under similar conditions, it can cause confusion, or when the same outcomes are achieved through different interactions, it forces people to learn multiple ways to complete their tasks.

If people are asking why something is the way it is, or why it is different, then they've been distracted by the interface. When designs are consistent in appearance and behavior, people are able to focus on their tasks, and they're not distracted by surprising or unexpected changes.

## Perceivability ##

If people are not aware that the opportunity to interact exists, we should not be surprised when they do not interact. Hidden interactions decrease usability and efficiency. People should not need to search for opportunities to interact. They should not guess when interacting, due to confusion or desperation.

We should be able to review an interface, and identify where we can interact. Interaction should not depend on luck or random discovery. Although much of our work is visual in nature, we need to remember that some people experience interfaces and devices differently. Do not hide important content and functionality behind invisible interactions. Provide hints and indicators; visual cues, such as buttons, icons, textures, and even different textiles let people know that this may be clicked or tapped.

Meaningful labels help people using screen readers differentiate between content and interactivity. The good news is that people are click or tap happy; they will attempt to interact with anything they think may produce a result or opportunity. Often those interface elements have a different appearance from the rest of the interface, or they have perceived affordances; that is, the interface element has characteristics of real objects. Buttons look pressable, because they resemble real, physical buttons.

Now, we've been talking about displaying opportunities to interact in terms of visibility, but we really should be thinking about this in terms of perceivability. We should always be considering accessibility, and some people may be using the interface by voice, sound, or touch; not vision.

The important point is that no matter how people are sensing and perceiving the interface, if they do not recognize the opportunity to interact, they will not interact. We often speak in terms of visibility, because so much of what we do in our day to day design work is based on the visual appearance. Although we often talk about providing visual cues for interaction opportunities, we should be thinking in a broader way. How do we communicate the opportunity to interact through multiple senses?

What does a button look like, feel like; sound like? How do we make sure that everyone can perceive the opportunity to interact? Good interaction design must go beyond the visual.

## Learnability ##

Interactions should be easy to learn, and easy to remember. Ideally, people should be able use an interface once, learn it, and remember it forever. Practically, people often need to use an interface at least a few times before they learn it, and then we hope that they will remember what they have learned.

Even easy to use interfaces require some degree of learning. When we say that an interface is intuitive, we really mean that it can be learned quickly and easily. The more we use an interface, and the more we learn, the easier it becomes. We can also take advantage of the transfer of skill or knowledge. People bring their experiences with them, and they will attempt to interact with an interface based on their experiences with other similar interfaces.

As long as people perceive the similarities among interfaces, they will transfer and apply what they have learned elsewhere. This is why design patterns and consistency are so important; people do not need to relearn what is familiar, and what they already know. It's faster to apply existing knowledge than to learn something new. 

## Predictability ##

Good interaction design should set accurate expectations about what will happen before the interaction has occurred. We should be able to show people an interface and ask, before they interact:

- What can you do here? 
- Where can you interact with this? 
- What will happen if you do that? 
- What will be the result, or outcome? 

If the opportunity to interact is perceivable, if the context is meaningful and sets the correct expectations, and if the outcomes are predictable, then people can answer those questions correctly.

We can set context and expectations by either demonstrating what can be done, such as animations, video, or overlays, or by describing what can be done, such as providing examples or instructions. Providing previews of interactions and outcomes helps people understand the functionality and the constraints, as well as the outcomes or results.

When people know what they can do, and what will happen, they will interact with the elements that are necessary to complete their task, and accomplish their goals. If we observe people interacting with an interface or device, we can often determine if they understand it, and are able to predict outcomes or not. Random interactions, guesses, trial and error, failure to make consistent progress toward a goal, and even the failure to interact at all, typically mean that the opportunities for interaction are not perceivable, meaningful, or predictable.

And yes, behavior with a device or interface differs between when we are task focused, versus playing games. Predictability is most important when people are task focused. Although we appreciate surprise and mystery when playing, remember that in these cases, unpredictability is intentional, and an important part of the game.

## Feedback ##

Feedback provides acknowledgment of our interactions, and information about their outcomes. We use feedback to understand where we are, our current condition or status, what we can do next, and even to know when we are finished. Feedback comes in many forms: selected states, highlights, dialogs, tool tips, confirmation and error messages, sounds, page refreshes, content updates, etc. And it can be subtle, such as breadcrumbs that tell us where we are on a Web site, or obvious and impossible to miss, such as a 404 page not found error.

Feedback should complement the experience, not complicate it. Do not interrupt people when they are engaged in a task, and don't withhold feedback when the information may be necessary to proceed. Provide feedback when people need it.
Feedback should be noticeable and meaningful.

Failing to acknowledge an interaction, or providing feedback that is not noticed, can lead to unnecessary repetition of actions, mistakes, and errors. There is a difference between mistakes and errors. A mistake is an incorrect choice, but it does not always result in an error. Feedback should confirm the interaction, and the outcome, and when interactions are important, the action should be verified, and people should have the opportunity to correct or undo possible mistakes.

## How the Principles Form a System ##

These five essential principles all work together in a system, tied together by observation, interaction, understanding, and the transfer of knowledge. When available interactions are perceivable, and noticeable, and when their outcomes can be accurately predicted, people will interact with the interface.

When meaningful feedback is provided after an interaction, people will understand how their actions led to the outcomes. When people understand the feedback from their interactions, and they learn how the interface works, with continued practice and observation of the interface, their learning becomes stronger.

Once people have learned how an interface works, they are able to transfer that knowledge and skill to other similar interfaces. As long as the interfaces are consistent within themselves, and across related or similar experiences, people will be able to apply what they have learned, and they will interact more efficiently and effectively.

As we craft increasingly complex designs for a growing variety of digital devices, remember that interaction design is not about the behavior of the interface; it's about the behavior of people. This course will provide a way to approach interaction design by combining design methods with psychological principles, and in the lessons ahead, we'll be diving more deeply into these principles, and exploring how to apply them to our designs.
