# Exploring Interaction Design #
## What is Interaction Design ##

Many people think of interaction design as rollovers, pop-ups, transitions, and animations, but it's actually a complex and wide ranging field that covers nearly all aspects of human cognition, emotion, and behavior.

There are also many different job titles and terms we may encounter, such as interaction designer, interactive designer, and experience designer. Although there may be subtle differences in our job descriptions and the tasks we undertake, in the end, we're all still focused on creating engaging interactive experiences between people and devices.

Interaction design is also more than just drawing the interface, and showing how to gather and display information. It's about designing for the entire interconnected system: the device, the interface, the context, the environment, and the people.

According to the Interaction Design Association, interaction design, often abbreviated IxD, defines the structure and
behavior of interactive systems. Interaction designers strive to create meaningful relationships between people and the products and services that they use, from computers, to mobile devices, to appliances, and beyond.

But interaction design is not a new field. Let's go back to the beginning of personal computers and Desktop software. One of the first proponents of interaction design in the 1980s, Bill Verplank, focused on designing for people; for their physical and emotional needs, and increasingly, for their intellect. He consistently considered three central questions about doing, feeling, and knowing to help us focus our designs.

Interaction design is not just about making us more efficient at work. We use devices in all aspects of our everyday life, including play and entertainment.

And Bill Moggridge has taught us about user-centered design, and the value of prototyping to test our ideas with real people. So you see, it's not just about the interface. Interaction design is about the behavior of people.

## The origins of interaction design ##

Let's take a brief trip back in time to explore the origins of modern interaction design for the devices in our lives today. We can look back over the history of humankind to see how we created tools and methods for recording information, such as painting and writing, manipulating information, such as triangulating and calculating, and communicating, such as printing and transmitting.

Each of the following historical moments has led to where we are today. We are able to record, manipulate, and share information about anything, at any time, with anyone. Almost two and a half million years ago, we began manipulating our environment with the first stone tools. As hunter-gatherers, we relied on these stones just to stay alive, but spoken languages began to emerge and evolve.

About 100,000 years ago, we started to communicate more effectively with each other. We relied on oral histories and personal contact to communicate information, but our inner creativity, and the need to share information with others, or even just record our shared stories and experiences, led us to begin drawing, and about 16,000 years ago some particularly talented ancestors recorded their stories for us on the walls of Lascaux cave.

It would take nearly 14,000 years for literal drawings and pictures to become the symbols, letters, and words that would make up the first written languages. Sumerian cuneiform text in clay, Egyptian hieroglyphics on papyrus, and
Babylonian maps, are among our oldest written records.

Around the same time, we see our first tool for manipulating information: the abacus, which made math easier. Once we began writing down information, drawing maps of the world around us, and making complex calculations easier, our knowledge expanded rapidly.

Around 300 years before the common era, or BCE, the Royal Library of Alexandria was founded as a repository of information. We were recording so much information that we needed to organize, store, and create a system for making it available and findable.

Our mechanical skills quickly improved. Soon we were measuring time and distance with clocks and astrolabes, as well as calculating the dates of future astronomical events with the Antikythera mechanism; our first mechanical computer.
Our initial measurements of time and distance were crude, but our clocks, compasses, and calendars improved.
Our knowledge of the world continued to grow rapidly, and we could no longer efficiently capture and store information just by hand writing and hand copying books.

The introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1440 suddenly made it possible to record more information, and make it available to more people than ever before. Our exploration of the world, the development of the scientific method, and the abundance of information being created required even more elaborate and capable mechanical calculators, like the slide rule, and the Stepped Reckoner, to help us make sense of it all.

Charles Babbage's Difference Engine in 1822 was our first step toward programmable computers. And in the decades after this, we saw the invention of the first photographs for capturing a realistic visual record, as well as both the telegraph, and the telephone.

We no longer needed to physically transport books, or personally travel, to access information; we could now transmit information nearly instantly over vast distances. Photography, telegraphy, and telephony advanced quickly, and in 1897, the first wireless transmissions over radio were made by Nikola Tesla.

The inventions and advancements of the industrial age generated huge amounts of visual, verbal, and written information, and by 1910, Paul Otlet recognized the need for a system to organize all of it, so he created the Mundaneum to gather and classify all of the world's knowledge. The Mundaneum has been called the forerunner of the Internet, because of its attempt to connect everything meaningfully. 

Meanwhile, technology progressed rapidly, and our mechanical calculators and computers began to be replaced with electronics. First came vacuum tubes, which made television signals possible, and which powered the world's first electronic computers during World War II. The war also pushed many technological advancements, and changed the way we
thought about computers, and what they can do for us.

In 1945, Vannevar Bush published an important essay, As We May Think, in which he proposed that we need to create a machine, which he called the Memex, that would become our collective memory, store information, and make it accessible to us, so that we would be less likely to repeat the mistakes of our past. He wanted to transform the information explosion into a knowledge explosion, and he may have sowed the seeds of the Internet.

In 1947, the transistor was introduced, and the world of electronics began to shrink. Televisions began to appear in our homes, and radios could be carried with us. In the 1950s, we sent our first manmade objects into space, and just a few years later, in 1962, Telstar started the era of satellite communications. We could now transmit even more information, more quickly, across longer distances than ever before.

The late 1960s were an important period, because Douglas Engelbart gave his Mother of All Demos, in which he showed us his vision of the modern computer, complete with a mouse.

And in 1969, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, also known as ARPANET, was launched. It would go on to become the basis for today's Internet. The arrival of the Intel microprocessor in 1971 ushered in the next era
of miniaturization.

And it wasn't long before we saw the first digital watches, and computer video games. We could now report vast quantities of information, process it, and make it available all around the world. Advances in technology moved very quickly from here.

The Xerox Alto was the first personal computer meant for businesses, and the Altair 8800 was the first computer sold as a do-it-yourself kit to hobbyists. This showed that there was a home market. 1977 was a big year, because three of the first truly personal computers, as well as the Atari 2600 gaming system, were all introduced.

These early computers had command line interfaces, and often needed to be programmed, so their appeal and usefulness was limited, but computers were in the home. Just a few years later, the mobile phone was introduced to the public, and in 1984, the Apple Macintosh arrived.

Although the Xerox Alto was the first graphical user interface, the Macintosh was the first computer to bring that interface into the home. Suddenly computers became easier to use and understand. By the late 1980s, computers were becoming commonplace, portable gaming devices were everywhere, and Tim Berners-Lee had drafted his proposal for an interconnected network of computers for sharing information based on hypertext.

On August 6, 1991, CERN launched the world's first Web site, based on the proposal of Tim Berners-Lee, and the Web was born. Mosaic, the first Web browser, was launched in 1993, and just two years later, the browser wars began, as millions and millions of people got on the Web.

In the meantime, mobile phones merged with digital cameras, personal computers became portable, commercial GPS data became available, and the digital music players were everywhere. We could talk, send text messages, capture photos, locate ourselves, get directions, and take our music and games with us.

Suddenly we had the ability to record, manipulate, and communicate and share information, with the electronic tools in our pockets. As these devices evolved and improved, we also saw a shift from indirect actions, such as command line interfaces, and using computer mice, to more direct action, such as touching and moving the icons directly on a screen.

And most recently, we've seen the introduction of spatial gestures. We no longer even need to use a mouse, or touch a screen, to interact with our devices. It's been a long 2.4 million years, and we've come a long way, but in the end, we are still just trying to record, manipulate, and share information. The tools are different, and continually changing, but our needs are the same, and as interaction designers, our goal is to make certain that these tools never get in the way.

## What Interaction Designers Contribute ##

Interaction designers work on interdisciplinary teams of various sizes, and collaborate with nearly every professional involved in the creation of the interfaces and devices all around us. I often say that if you want an instant subject matter expert, just add an information or interaction designer to the project, because it is our responsibility to understand the business requirements, the user's needs and expectations, the technological opportunities and constraints, the purpose of the device or interface, and the context in which it will be used.

We also need to be able to quickly and frequently change our perspective on a project, from the high-altitude strategic view, to the detailed tactical view, and back. This includes answering questions from both the strategic and the tactical perspectives, such as:

- Why does the device or interface exist? 
- What's the business model? 
- What value does it provide? 
- What are the users needs? 
- How does it work? 
- What's the design solution?

So the interaction designer brings diverse skills to collaborate in constantly changing, challenging, and innovative environments.

## Understanding the Interaction Design Process ##

How do we work? What are our processes and methods? There are many ways to accomplish our design goals, and different teams, agencies, and companies will have their own methods. Some still work in a traditional waterfall process, where each discipline completes their contribution before the next discipline begins. Others are influenced by the agile approach, and the entire team tackles one component of the project at a time in rapid sprints.

And there are also a myriad of hybrid approaches that leverage iteration, collaboration, and testing. There is no single way to achieve strong designs in the desired outcomes, but at the core, there are some processes in which nearly all interaction designers engage: definition, research, ideation, design, prototyping, observation, and
iteration as needed.

Let's go through each of these, starting with definition. We must define the project, the product, and the design task at hand, and understand what we are trying to solve or achieve. How we define a problem determines if and how we are able to solve it.

Once we have defined the project, then we begin our research. This occurs in parallel with nearly every step in our process. We need to gather data to help us, define the product or the problem, generate ideas and potential solutions, inform our designs and prototypes, and guide our iterations.

We use data to form the foundation of our final product, and our initial research gives us direction, but we should always be seeking more data. Research never really ends. Once we understand the problem, we need to generate possible solutions through ideation.

We think, collaborate, sketch, ponder, wonder, dream, and draw. We generate many possibilities, select a few, and pursue only the best. Apple encourages a process where their teams generate 10 viable ideas, select the top three, and refine them, then choose only the best one to pursue. They throw away 90% of their ideas in order to achieve their best.

In design and prototyping, we create models of our possible solutions to test them, ensure they are complete, and that they help people solve problems, complete tasks, and achieve goals. Our designs range from low fidelity sketches, to high fidelity wireframes, and visual comps. And our prototypes vary from simple objects, or click through sequences, to
elaborate functional interfaces, and mock devices.

But most importantly, we take the time to think through the steps of the interactions, to consider the presentation of the information, and to validate the purpose and value of the product. No design is perfect the first time it is drawn or modeled.

That's where iteration comes in. No matter how carefully we try to consider the needs and perspective of others,
we can't anticipate everything. We're not designing for ourselves, and when we observe others interact with our designs and prototypes, we inevitably find opportunities to improve the design, and so we iterate, evolving the design as we gather data, making it better with each round until it is ready.

When a product, device, or interface is ready to launch, we are still not finished. Iteration is more than just refining the design.

It also includes monitoring the performance, usability, accessibility, and the success of a product after it's been released. We gather data, speak with and observe users, gather usage and error data, and look for opportunities to modify, improve, and enhance that product.

Then the design process continues again, and again.
