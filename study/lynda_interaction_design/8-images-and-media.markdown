Defining Sensation and Perception

Sensation and perception are stages of processing information from our sensory systems.
Sensation occurs when an external event, called a stimulus, causes a biochemical
reaction in a sensory organ.
This information passes from the sensory organs, such as the eyes, ears, and skin,
to the brain, where perception occurs.
Perception is the process of becoming aware of, and assigning meaning to, sensory stimuli.
For example, an object, such as a bicycle, reflects light.
That light enters the eye, and causes a reaction in the retina.
The light becomes the stimulus.
The stimulus travels to the brain, where it is analyzed and processed, and when we
find matching information in our memory, we recognize the object, and assign
meaning to the perception: bicycle.
But there is a blurry line between sensation and perception.
We can only become aware of stimuli that we're able to sense.
For example, as humans, we cannot see infrared or ultraviolet light with our
eyes, and not all of the stimuli that generate a signal in our nervous system
actually gets processed for awareness and meaning.
A tremendous amount of sensory information around us actually gets filtered out
before it even reaches the parts of the brain that would process it for meaning.
Of all the information in the world around us, we pay attention to a very
small, select amount.
As designers, we need to help people focus their attention on what's
important, and we need to make it easier for them to understand the meaning of that information.
Our senses are vision, hearing, taste, smell, touch, and proprioception, which
is our internal sense of relative position and movement; we use this to track
our own body parts.
But some of these are not yet relevant to interface design.
We tend to focus on just three:
vision, because we look at interfaces;
hearing, because we listen to audio feedback and spoken text;
and touch, we feel vibrations in the surface when we interact with
interfaces and devices.
Proprioception is becoming increasingly important as a design consideration
because we're beginning to create interfaces that leverage spatial gestures.
Many devices now have sensors that detect motion, direction, rotation, and
acceleration, and deceleration.
Computers can receive data about our movement in much the same way our brains do,
and this gives us another way to interact with information and the devices in
the world around us: through gestures and motion.
Perception seems to be an effortless process, because we do not feel like we're
thinking about everything we sense in order to understand it.
The meaning is just present and available to us, because most of the perceptual
processing occurs outside of our conscious awareness,
but perception is not an automatic, passive process.
It's influenced by our learning, experience, memory, and expectations based on context.
Sensation and perception are both bottom-up and top-down processes.
Sensory information is used to build up or assemble meaningful objects.
This is a bottom-up process, where meaning is constructed from sensory stimuli.
Perceptual processes find meaning by disassembling and examining the parts of whole objects.
This is a top-down process, where meaning is found by matching things from
our past experience.
For example, if I smell lemon, taste sweetness, and feel creamy frosting on my
tongue, I may conclude that I'm eating cake; a bottom-up process, where I
assemble individual sensory experiences into a single meaning: cake.
And if I taste cake, hear singing, feel happy, and see festive decorations, I may
conclude that I am at a birthday party; a top-down process, where I examine each
object in context, and derive meaning based on my past experience with parties.
How people respond to a device or interface depends upon more than just how
it looks or sounds.
Their response is influenced by their prior experiences and their expectations,
which is why we need to consider both; how they sense the interface, as well as
the context and expectations.
What we want and expect to experience can influence what we actually experience.
Still, there are very consistent ways that people perceive the world, and we can
leverage these in our designs.
The Gestalt Laws -- remember proximity, similarity, closure, and the others --
are perceptual processes we all share, and which help us organize our
sensory experiences.
The world is a highly variable and changing place, yet we perceive it with
remarkable stability and constancy.
Changes in lighting, distance, and angle of vision do not change our ability
to recognize objects.
We have perceptual constancy for shape, whiteness, color, distance, size,
location, and timbre, or the quality of sound.
We see the same color or brightness even when the lighting changes.
For example, if the lighting changes to red, and I hold this card, what color
does it look like to you?
But now if the lighting changes back to white, you know that this card is white,
and you knew that even when you saw it under red light, and even though it was
reflecting red light to your eye.
The perceptual constancy told you that this color was white.
We understand that size and scale do not change, even when distance to the object
changes, and we recognize the same voices and sounds, even when there are other
sounds and noise present.
As long as we have enough sensory data to assemble a mental representation of
the object, we can recognize it.
We take advantage of perceptual constancy for shape and size when we use
different typefaces.
The shapes and sizes of the letters vary greatly, yet we're still able to
quickly and accurately recognize them, and understand the words they represent.
This is a top-down process, because we take what we have learned about letter
shapes in our past experience, and apply that to new objects.
The context of our perceptions involves our current situation, and expectations,
but it also involves our current sensory experience.
Our perceptions can be enhanced or diminished based on the sensory information.
The same color can look different when surrounded by different colors.
Do the smaller squares in these images have the same or different colors in each?
This is an example of simultaneous contrast, and affects how we perceive color.
Finally, when we interfere with sensation and perception, we can generate
perceptual illusions.
Sometimes we can take advantage of this, such as using camouflage to obscure the
boundaries of objects, but we usually want to avoid creating illusions, because
it introduces inconsistency, unpredictability, and ambiguity into the experience.
Although we cannot control the way someone senses and perceives their world, we
can craft designs that make it easier for people to understand information, and
how to interact with interfaces and devices.

How People Respond to Color

Have you ever wondered why there are so many yellow buttons, or why we often use
red, orange, and yellow to attract attention?
Even though there are sociocultural meanings associated with colors, such as
red means danger or stop, there are also physiological reasons why yellow and
red attract our attention.
Our eyes are actually more sensitive to yellow, orange, and red than to any other colors.
We all know that computer monitors create colors by mixing different ratios of
red, blue, and green light.
Well, the human eye is sensitive to color with a similar system of color receptors.
This is described by the trichromatic theory.
We have a light-sensitive cells in our eyes that detect red, green, and blue
light, and our brain combines the different ratios of incoming light into all of
the colors we see in the world around us.
But why are we more sensitive yellows and reds? Because the number of red, green,
and blue cells are not equal.
About 64% of the cells are sensitive to red, about 26% of the cells are
sensitive to green, and about 10%, sometimes even less, are sensitive to blue.
Since nearly two thirds of the color sensitive cells in our eyes are sensitive
to red, it should be no surprise that we tend to notice red things, but it's
not just the number of color sensitive cells that determines what we pay attention to.
Each type of cell is actually sensitive to a range of colors wider than pure
red, pure green, and pure blue.
If we look at the range of colors, and the peak sensitivity for each type of
cell, we quickly notice that cells sensitive to blue light are not only the
smallest percentage of cells, but they also have the least overlap in
sensitivity with the other cells.
We're physically less sensitive to blue, purple, and indigo than any other colors.
The green and red sensitive cells actually have peak sensitivities very close to
one another, and they overlap significantly in the yellow and orange range.
This means that 90% of the color sensitive cells in our eyes are sensitive to a
common range of colors: yellows, and oranges.
Our attention is drawn to yellow and orange, because those colors produce more
activity in color sensitive cells in the eye and brain than any other colors.
Since we are most sensitive to yellows, oranges, and reds, and since red has
sociocultural meaning in the West for danger or to stop, it makes sense that we
would use these colors to attract attention for warning and error messages.
However, we need to be careful when using bright yellows and oranges, because
they can also cause visual fatigue.
And when everything is yellow or orange, it can be more difficult to direct a
person's attention where we want them to look.
We can use yellow, orange, or red buttons or icons on fields of weaker colors to
focus attention on key interaction opportunities, but we don't have to use
yellow. We can also rely on color differences to stand out, so a lone green
button can also draw attention.
On monochromatic sites with little color variation, we need to actively scan and
process what we see before we understand where we can interact.
Color theory from graphic design can help us identify colors and color
combinations that can effectively guide and focus attention.
For more on this topic, check out the design courses on color here at Lynda.com.
We also need to remember that as many as 10% of people -- far more men than
women -- have some form of color deficient vision, and have difficulty
distinguishing colors.
The most common form of color deficient vision involves the inability to
accurately distinguish between red and green.
A less common form of color deficient vision involves the inability to
distinguish between yellow and blue, and a very rare form involves the inability
to perceive any color.
When designing for color deficient vision, we need to make certain that we
are not relying solely on color cues, and that important colors can be differentiated.
For example, do not just use red and green fill colors to convey information;
also use meaningful text labels, or even use distinct shapes to make it easier to understand.
Also, choose colors that are not pure.
For example, rather than a pure red, add a little yellow, and rather than pure
green, add a little blue.
Even minor color adjustments can make a perceptual difference for people with
color deficient vision.
Finally, we need to be careful about using certain color combinations, not
because they're aesthetically unpleasant, although they may be, but because they
can lead to chromostereopsis, a visual illusion of depth caused by specific
adjacent colors, usually red and blue, or red and green.
When these colors are side by side, the edges or boundaries between them can
appear to vibrate or oscillate between foreground and background.
Chromostereopsis makes it difficult to discern a clear edge, and it can also
lead to visual fatigue.
Choosing colors is an important aesthetic decision for designers, but we should
also choose colors that help make it easier for people to direct their attention,
and which support the information.

How People Respond to Motion

One of the most effective ways to attract someone's attention is with motion.
Movement captures our attention very effectively, and can be used to quickly
direct the eye's gaze to a specific location.
Our brains are wired to detect change. Think about the number of times that a
small movement in your peripheral vision caused you to reflexively turn and look.
Nearly all organisms have this sensitivity to motion, because it's advantageous
to pay attention to things that move in our environment.
Is that predator coming to eat me?
We can use motion when designing interfaces to do three things:
motion can direct attention. When we want people to pay attention to something,
we can use movements, such as rotating or shaking, pulsing, or zooming in and out.
Even color or brightness that fades in or out can draw the eye to that part of
the screen, where there is important information.
Motion can be important when hiding and revealing information. When we want
to communicate what information currently in view is being hidden, but is
still readily available,
we can use sliding or zooming motion to show where the information may be found
when it is needed again.
Hide and show functionality typically uses the same type of motion, but in
opposite directions.
Information may collapse upward when hidden, and expand downward when revealed.
Motion can make connections or associations.
When we want to show that information is related, grouped, or being moved to a
new place or category, we can use motion to show that information moved from
one place to another.
Drag and drop is a form of movement performed by the person.
If we want to change the location of something like a photo, we can drag it into
a new position or album.
We can also use sliding, zoom, and fade transitions to show where a piece of
information has been moved, and with what it's now associated.
Unfortunately, movement can also lead to distraction.
Ads with animation or video are probably the most common example of motion
causing distraction.
Most of us have had the experience of trying to read an article online, and
having our gaze reflexively redirected by ads elsewhere on the screen, even when
we're trying very hard to maintain our focus and attention.
If we are distracted often enough, we become inefficient, and
possibly frustrated.
We may even abandon what we are doing.
Banner ad creators may like this technique to draw attention, but from the
perspective of the person viewing the screen or page, this is often an
unwanted distraction.
Use motion carefully, because it's easy to distract and detract from the
experience rather than attract, focus, and enhance.
One of the reasons why motion can be effective to direct attention is because
the movement occurs all on the same visible screen.
We never lose view of the current information.
Items on the screen simply move to a new location, or move out of view to a new place.
The persistent context of the screen makes it easier to understand what the
motion communicates.
However, when information changes or moves between subsequent views of the same
page or screen, we may not notice it.
In other words, if we don't see the movement, or see the change happen, we don't notice it.
This is called change blindness, and it happens when we see two successive views
of the same screen, with a slight pause and a blank screen between them, which is
common on the Web when we have a full page refresh.
In this example, we see two versions of the same screen, with a brief pause and
blank screen between them, and it's very difficult to notice what changes.
Many Web sites have this problem when they refresh a page and change a small
part of the content.
The first view of the page and the second view of the page are separated by a
brief pause, and a blank browser canvas.
If the second view of the page doesn't obviously highlight the changed
information for us, we must spend more time and effort reviewing the updated
page, and comparing the new version to our memory of the previous version to try
and identify what's changed.
We may not even notice the difference, yet we've expanded a large cognitive effort.
If we can avoid a full screen refresh with a blank pause between the views, then
any changes to the content will be much easier to detect.
This is a strength of rich Internet applications that update only the content on
the screen that needs to be changed.
When everything else remains the same, the information or objects that change
will draw attention, the same way motion attracts attention.
If we must refresh the entire screen, and risk showing a blank pause between the
views, then we need to add an extra cues to the design to ensure that people
will notice that change.
Use a different color, or other visual indicators, such as sticky tool tips, or
overlays, to highlight what has changed, and use a timed fade to remove these
cues and indicators after a few seconds, so that they don't distract the person
as they continue to interact.
Finally, we can't talk about motion without mentioning video.
Video has become an important part of the experiences on the Web, as we
watch more news, television, movies, and user generated video on our connected devices.
Video on a page or screen attracts our attention like any other motion, but it
also conveys a tremendous amount of information, and it's often the most
important content on the page.
Delivering video involves both design and technology considerations.
On the design side, we need to include usable media player controls, and avoid
autoplay as much as possible, because people like to have an internal locus of
control, and want to be in charge of their media experience.
Although motion and video may present a few additional design and technology
challenges, they are important types of information, and we can design usable,
effective, and pleasing experiences by applying the same design principles and
best practices that apply to any type of content.

Establishing Visual Hierarchy

We know we can influence where people direct their attention, and how they
perceive a Web application.
We're more sensitive to certain colors, and motion, and we're susceptible to
perceptual illusions, and ambiguity.
But we can take what we know about sensation and perception, and use that to
establish a visual hierarchy on the page or screen.
Although this really isn't a course about visual design, many of these
techniques also apply to interaction design.
Value and contrast can attract attention, and establish importance.
Content that is darker, and has higher contrast with what surrounds it,
will attract attention.
Large, bold, dark font faces for headers are effective, because they combine size
and value to draw our attention.
Color can also draw attention; orange and yellow buttons attract attention,
because we're very sensitive to those colors.
Text links with a different color from the text around them stand out and
attract attention, because they're different.
Whitespace, or negative space, can help highlight information.
A bit of content surrounded by generous whitespace will stand out and draw
attention, because it's clearly separate from the remaining content.
Motion draws attention reflexively, because we're sensitive to change.
When something moves in our environment, it's difficult to not look at it.
Finally, images, especially photos with faces, and graphics, such as charts,
icons, and illustrations, draw attention before blocks of text.
Our eyes are nearly always drawn to pictures before words.
It's possible to guide attention, and the eye, by carefully selecting, positioning,
and displaying information.
We can make it more likely that people will sense, perceive, and understand the
content on a page or screen with good design.
