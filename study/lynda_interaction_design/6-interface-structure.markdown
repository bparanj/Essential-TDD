Principles of Interface Structure

Studying how we perceive the world around us has long been an area of interest
for artists, designers, and scientists.
In 1910, Max Wertheimer, a German psychologist, noticed that a series of blinking
lights creates the illusion of motion.
Theater marquees take advantage of this illusion, known as the phi effect, to
create the racing lights encircling the name of the play or movie.
Modern design software uses a similar effect, often called marching ants, to
highlight a marquee drawn to outline an area of an image.
Wertheimer and his colleagues, Kurt Koffka and Wolfgang Kohler, studied perception
for the next several years, and in the 1920s, Gestalt psychology emerged.

The term Gestalt is a German word that means shape or form, and the Gestalt
principles and laws describe how we perceive the world around us as meaningful
and complete objects, with a clear distinction between foreground and background.

We perceive whole objects; not a series of independent parts.
There are several Gestalt Laws that describe how we organize our perceptual
experiences, and we can use these organizational principles to create designs
that are more meaningful, and easier to perceive.

Good design, with solid perceptual structure, actually makes it easier for people
to understand and interact with the interface.
Before we describe the Gestalt Laws, we need to define two fundamental
organizational principles: Figure-Ground, and the Law of Pragnanz.

Figure-Ground describes how we organize our perceptions in terms of foreground
objects or figures, which are clearly defined, such as a tree, and the background,
which may be unbounded or vaguely defined, such as the sky.

The Law of Pragnanz describes how we organize our perceptions into the simplest
possible experience.

We will interpret ambiguous, vague, or complex objects in the simplest possible way.
The Law of Pragnanz is also sometimes called the Law of Good Figure, or the Law
of Simplicity, which make perfect sense.

Why would our brains expend the effort necessary to process overly complex
perceptions, when it easier and faster to perceive things in a simpler way?

The Gestalt Laws help us describe and understand how we arrive at this
perceptual simplicity, but they also help us understand why vague or
ambiguous shapes and images can be hard to understand, and may even lead to
perceptual illusions.

The Law of Proximity states that objects near one another in space or time are
perceived as being a group, and belonging together.

The Law of Similarity states that objects with similar characteristics, such as
form, color, size, and brightness, are perceived as belonging together.

The Law of Closure explains why incomplete figures are perceived as complete or whole.

The Law of Common Fate describes how objects moving together are perceived
as belonging together.

The Law of Continuity states that objects aligned along a line or curve are
perceived as belonging together,
and we will perceive the simplest, smooth path, rather than a complex path. And
the Law of Symmetry explains our tendency to perceive symmetric objects as
figures on a background.

People show a preference for symmetry, but this law also explains perceptions
that exhibit multistability;
situations where our brain flips back and forth between two distinct perceptions,
such as this Rubin vase.

The Gestalt Laws can be used to describe how we perceive much of the structure
and meaning in digital interfaces.
Looking at this Web page, we can find examples of each law.
These tabs and this checkout information form two distinct groups, because of
the Law of Proximity.

These tabs and the navigational system strengthen our perception of groups,
because they have similar characteristics.
We perceive this rectangle for the coupon, as a whole rectangle, even though it
is clearly obstructed, and we cannot see all of it.

The use of the dashed stroke in the product grid relies on the Law of
Continuity for us to perceive this as a solid line, and our eyes follow along that dotted path.

And when we choose to add an item to the cart, we receive feedback in the form of
a mini cart, and it slides down as a drawer, and we perceive that as a group
because all of those pieces of information move together; the Law of Common Fate.

Remember, the Gestalt Laws has describe how and why we perceive the world as
filled with whole distinct objects.

They're not rules for how to design. When we encounter devices or interfaces
that are vague, ambiguous, and difficult to understand, we can use the Gestalt
Laws to help us identify the source of the confusion, then develop ways to
improve the design, and ensure that people are perceiving the device or interface
in a clear and understandable way.

Designing with Grids

Grids have a long history in print design, but they've not always been employed
for the design of digital interfaces.

There are some key differences between print and digital design that affect how we use grids.
The printed page has fixed dimensions, yet a digital screen allows us to
dynamically change the size of the content area.
We can scroll vertically and horizontally.
We can scale the screen by zooming in and out, and we can look at the same
information on many different screen sizes.
This means the digital screens require flexibility with grids that the
printed pages do not,
and as designers, we need to think about how information and functionality will
be displayed across many screens.

There are many different grid systems and methods for using grids in design,
from counting columns, to ratio-based grids, but all grid systems lend structure
and consistency to the layout.

Let's take a brief look at the major types.
Column-based grid systems often start with a specific screen width, such as 960
pixels, then divide the screen up into multiple columns, such as 12 or 16 columns,
often a number divisible by three or four, and with a gap or gutter between those columns.

Ratio-based grid systems take a starting screen width, and divide it into
columns based on mathematical formulas, such as the Rule of Thirds or the Golden Ratio.
These grids are often selected for their column sizes that mirror natural
proportions for a sense of balance.

Since these grids are proportionate, they can be applied to nearly any screen
size, and retain their structure.

Responsive grid systems are used when we need to create responsive design that
adapt as screen sizes change, and we often need to define multiple states of the
flexible grid system, and how it will respond to scaling.

For example, four columns of Web content on a laptop might become two columns on
a tablet, and only one column on a mobile phone, and the width of the columns
might have minimum and maximum values to accommodate different screen sizes.

When using a grid system, content and images may span just one, or several, columns.
This gives us the opportunity to create a more flexible structure, without
requiring all content to fit into the same column widths in all places.

It's okay to allow different content elements to span a different number of columns,
as long as we create and adhere to sensible rules that guide the use of the grid
across all pages and screens.

Why should we use grids when designing?
Well, grids provide structure and balance. Keeping content and images aligned to
the grid makes it easier to scan and read the screen, and it gives the design a
more professional appearance, which is important for trust and credibility.
This structure is also essential for consistency; one of our five
interaction design principles.

Grid systems for screen interfaces typically focus more on columns, and less on
rows, because page and screen length vary greatly with the amount of information
being displayed, and as screen sizes change, the pages can become even longer. We
also need to remember that interfaces often have a different appearance on
different devices, which can affect the way information is displayed.

For example, different computers may render font faces differently, making them
appear larger or smaller, and even wrapping the texts differently.
Since content varies, and may be displayed differently, it's often difficult to
maintain a tight layout that locks the content to horizontal grid rows.
Unless we know that the content will have a fixed height, such as images in
a photo album, we should plan for content to flow flexibly within the columns of the grid.
We often need to build grids around constraints, such as banner ads, mandatory
image sizes, and nonwrapping headers with maximum character accounts.
When we have objects with fixed dimensions, we often start defining our grid
system with those constraints in mind, and we create columns that are equal, or
add up, to the fixed dimensions.

Finally, the grid system not only provides structure and rhythm for our
design, but it also facilitates the development process, because adhering to
a grid provides a framework for the underlying code for the interface, and
makes it easier to keep all of the content and images on the screen aligned
and proportionate.

Guiding Visitors with Sequence, Steps and Structure

When people see content presented in an orderly way, and functionality located
in the same or similar places, which produces consistency, they learn how to
look for other content and functionality on other screens or pages, which
enhances learnability,
and their eyes and hands go to those locations more readily, which
demonstrates predictability.

So far, we've been talking about structure mostly in terms of spatial location:
where it's located in the interface, but we can also provide structure in terms
of time: the sequence or steps by which something occurs.
We need to provide structure in terms of both place and time.
How do we provide structure for time?
How do we guide people through an experience that may span multiple steps or screens?

First, we need to set expectations about the process. How long will it take? How
many steps are there?

Second, we need to break down complex processes into simpler, more manageable steps.

And the third, we need to design an experience that provides feedback about
status and progress to lead people forward through the interaction.

Remember, the goal-gradient effect? People are more motivated to complete a task
the closer they get to the goal.

Some of the most common interface methods for guiding people are using numbered
steps, estimating duration, and indicating the percent complete.

Examples of step by step guidance include checkout on shopping sites, account
registration, and building a social profile on a social network.

Pagination controls are useful when there is much content, such as search results,
and people want to rapidly skip to a specific point.

Page numbers, the number of items per page, and knowing how many items are
sorted and displayed, help people understand where they are, and where they might
find something they need.

Previous and next controls are used when there is a linear process, which takes
people through a complex action one step at a time.

This conceals the complexity by showing just one task or question.
People can move backward to modify their previous choices and answers, but often
they can only move forward to the next step, and not skip around.

Good typographic practices provide excellent structure and guidance.
Headers, and subheaders, line height, or leading, indentation, and bullet lists
help identify the key points.

Careful selection of font face, as well as judicious use of text styles, helps
guide the eye when scanning, and makes it easier to find important information.
Grids of content or images provide both structure and implicit
sequence information.

As Westerners, we think of the top left grid position as first, and the bottom
right position as last, but we might also think of these grid sequences as
ranked from best to worst.

Remember, we bring our past experiences with us, so what we have learned on
other Web sites, devices, and interfaces influences our expectations and
predictions about how new devices and interfaces work.

As designers, we can take advantage of this by placing elements in places where
we know people are more likely to look for them, and by arranging tasks in
steps that are familiar.

How do you narrow down a large set of search results?
Do you enter your credit card number at the beginning or end of the checkout
process when shopping online?
How do you skip to the next song on your phone or music player?

We all have expectations about how to do these things based on past experience,
and we'll talk about this again when we discuss mental models.

What happens when we fail to meet people's expectations and predictions?
What if we put things in unexpected or unrelated places, or move them around from page to page?
What if we arrange tasks in an unexpected sequence?
What if we present information in random or poorly organized ways?

In all of these cases, we reduce usability, reduce meaningfulness, increase
confusion, and increase the amount of time it takes to understand and complete a task.
We also increase the probability that people will abandon the interactions, and
your device or interface.

Structure and sequence are important, not just for appearance, but also for
consistency, learnability, and predictability.

Understanding Design Patterns

We're often faced with the same or similar design problems repeatedly
across multiple projects.
Design patterns are optimal solutions
to recurring problems.
They help us solve similar problems, consistently and efficiently.
We certainly learn from our past experience, and we're able to solve similar
problems more quickly, but we could be even more efficient if we were to leverage
a library of reusable interaction design patterns that have already been defined
and categorized, and which are ready to be applied to our current project.
We can take advantage of existing design pattern libraries, and we might
even build our own,
especially if we work in a very specialized field, like health care or finance.
It takes experience and time to identify good design patterns, but when an
optimal solution is identified, it can spread quickly through the design
community, and may appear in many devices and interactions.
A good design pattern has an evolutionary path.
First it starts as an idea, or proposed solution to a problem, and if it succeeds,
then it's remembered and reused.
Next, if other designers adopt that solution, and they begin reusing it
successfully, it becomes a best practice.
We often borrow the best ideas from others, and try to improve them, then when a
best practice is formally described, recorded, and recommended as a preferred
solution, it becomes a convention.
And finally, when a convention is formally adopted by professional organizations
as the way things are done, it becomes a standard.
Design patterns must adapt and change, because technology changes, people learn,
and grow, devices and situations change, and our expectations change.
What works as an optimal solution today may not be the optimal solution next
week, next month, or next year.
Would the design solutions for a Web site in 1996 stand up to the requirements
of mobile devices with touchscreens, or the spatial gestures of home video game systems today?
What are some examples of familiar and successful design patterns?
You're probably already using interaction design patterns without even realizing it.
Accordion panes make it possible to show a lot of content in a limited space,
by dividing the content into multiple sections, or panes, and showing only one
pane open at a time.
Carousels are often used when we have many images, but not enough space to
arrange them in a grid,
so we show a few at a time in a horizontally scrolling row, and hop-ups are
layers of content that appear over the page to provide additional, or more
specific, information.
But not all patterns are good or optimal;
Anti-patterns are commonly reinvented ineffective or bad solutions to design problems.
On the surface, they may seem like a good solution, but in practice they
interfere, obstruct, or hinder the experience.
Some anti-patterns exist because design solutions are copied from one problem,
and applied to a different problem without being properly modified, or worse yet,
without even being the correct solution to the problem.
Other anti-patterns exist because a potentially relevant solution is
improperly applied.
For example, pogo sticking refers to navigation that requires the user to drill
down, perform an action, navigate back up, proceed to the next step or item,
then drill back down to perform the action again.
Repeated up and down navigation to perform the same repetitive task is common,
but very inefficient.
Idiot boxes interrupt the experience to either ask people if they are sure they
want to perform an action that has already been done, or to confirm an action
that has already provided feedback in another way.
For example, after we drag and drop something into a new location, we see it in
the new position, but then a dialog hops up over the screen to tell us that we
successfully dragged something to a new position.
Some patterns are even malicious. Dark patterns are not mistakes, or poor design.
They are intentional design decisions created to mislead, and misdirect us, to
make choices or perform actions we would not otherwise do.
They take advantage of ambiguity, inattention, forgetfulness, distraction,
and even fear and anxiety to direct us toward actions that are not in our best interests.
Unfortunately, most of us have encountered dark patterns.
Here is a few examples: warning messages that tell us our computer has been
infected when it hasn't,
but clicking on the Fix It Now button actually installs the Malware that
infects our system.
Ambiguously written text that makes it impossible to determine what will happen
when we take action.
For example, am I subscribing or unsubscribing to these e-mail announcements?
And ads that make it look like the legitimate functionality of the Web site or
application, but trick people into clicking on the ad, because they think they're
interacting with the site.
Many of us work in fields where we encounter the same or similar design
problems regularly, but the solutions are far more specific and specialized than
accordion panes or tool tips,
so we need to create our own pattern libraries.
Your design pattern library may be as large and well-defined as you need, but
every pattern definition has a few common characteristics:
the name of the pattern, a description of the pattern, the context in which the
problem occurs, and the solution to the problem.
Some libraries also include additional information to better define the design
pattern, such as identifying the principles that underlie the solution, an
explanation of why the solution works, and examples of the pattern in use.
Design pattern libraries can also include reusable graphics, symbols, assets, and
styles, in addition to the description of the solutions.
Designers can
create and maintain design libraries with reusable design elements.
Nearly all design software tools have the ability to create symbols and styles,
and most designers maintain libraries of assets and images, such as tabs and
buttons that can be leveraged.
Take advantage of your past work by creating your own design pattern libraries,
and collections of assets, symbols, and styles to facilitate the application of
those design patterns.
