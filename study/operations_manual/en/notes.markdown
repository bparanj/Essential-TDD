 Always plan before writing
 Know what you want to achieve and what your reader wants to achieve
 Plan a style that suits your brand
 Find out what your target readers are Googling
 Use the supplied questionnaires until you’re comfortable planning without them
 Start your post wherever you need to — wherever feels most natural
 Resign yourself to the fact that you’ll often feel like your post is out of control
 Don’t aim for perfection
 Don’t sweat it; many problems will fizzle away as you progress
 Be disciplined — keep chipping away
 But learn to recognize when you need to take a break
 Accept that taking a break isn’t always a waste of time

Break any of these guidelines when you need to.

** First Week of Blogging **

1. Your launch post is the first post you’ll publish to your blog. In most cases, it should:

• introduce the blog and you as the blogger
• explain why you created the blog
• identify the types of problems the blog will solve, questions it will answer, or help it will provide to visitors.

In your first post you can say how often you intend to publish new content, invite them to subscribe to your newsletter or RSS feed and solicit their feedback on the idea.

2. Create a my story post

A “my story” post briefly tells the story of your involvement in the niche you’ve chosen to blog about. It might include:

• how many years or months you’ve been interested in the topic
• evidence of your passion for, or expertise in, the topic area, including links to other work you’ve
done or related projects you’ve been involved with
• a brief, heartfelt explanation of your motivations for starting the blog
• a statement of your hopes for the blog’s future, including how you anticipate it will meet the needs of visitors.

3. Pillar Content

4. Enter the blog post title and paste in the url on Twitter account. Use bit.ly to shorten.
5. Search for peer bloggers or businesses within your niche on the social network you’ve chosen. Follow (on twitter), friend or become a fan of (on Facebook) those you find interesting or relevant to what you’re doing.
Who should you follow or friend?
Follow people or organizations that you can learn from, that you want to watch (competitors, perhaps), and that are of professional interest to you.

6. Pick up a related magazine to find topics to write articles.

7. Promote a valuable resource through social media
	1. Visit your favorite sites in your blog’s niche.
	2. Find an article, link or resource that you feel is valuable and relevant. 
	3. Copy that link.
	4. Create an update in your social media account that says something enticing about the resource you’re linking to – explain why it’s worth looking at. Paste in the link and publish your update.
	
Don’t be tempted to send every article or resource you come across to all your social media contacts. Instead, choose only the best resources – the ones that you like the most.

8. Use blog comments to generate content ideas
	Create a mindmap for these ideas and write articles on those topics.

9. Research audience needs using social media
	• Tap into the topic you’re researching
	• Ask contacts about how a specific aspect of that topic affects them
	• Encourage them to share their thoughts, concerns or limitations regarding that topic.

10. Distribute a good link or resource to your social network 	
	Post a snippet of your comment on a resource you like
	  In this update quote part of your own (insightful, valuable) comment on someone else’s content, and include a link to that content.
	Post a quote from the resource itself
	  Find a particularly relevant or impressive snippet within the resource you’re linking to and quote that in your status update.
	Post the link with a question you have about it
	  To start a discussion, post the resource link with a question you have about the resource as a means to solicit discussion with your contacts. Ask for their take on the issues covered.
	
	1. Create a status update that includes a link to a really valuable resource you’ve found within your niche.
	2. spellcheck the update and check that the link works.
	3. Publish that update for your contacts to see.
