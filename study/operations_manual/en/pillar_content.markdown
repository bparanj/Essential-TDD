## Generate Ideas for Pillar Content ##

Pillar content is foundational or basic content that is essential knowledge for anyone in your niche. It’s evergreen content – it never dates or loses relevance – and it’s the kind of information that people within your audience would search a search engine. 

Find a topic and create a pillar content mindmap. Use Google keyword research tool to find themes.

1. On your mindmap, identify a basic or elementary aspect of your topic that fits the “pillar content” description above.
2. Spend ten minutes brainstorming around that topic. Break it down into its component parts and consider it from different angles.
3. Finally, draw up a list of pillar content ideas that you could create as individual blog posts, or a series.
4. Save this list to your ideas folder for reference in the coming days and weeks.
