## Writing Guidelines ##

1. Make your intro easy to read

Start with a short sentence, keep the majority of your sentences relatively short, use short, easy-to-understand words, and make the intro paragraph as short as possible.

2. Write as much as you need to but no more

3. Address the reader as 'you'

4. Write effective headings

5. The most effective headings usually possess one or more of four qualities:
	1. Self interest e.g. “Pay 50% less on PCs”
	2. News e.g. “PCs now 50% cheaper: World first e- commerce site”
	3. Curiosity e.g. “Half-price PCs: You won’t believe how they do it!”
	4. A quick, easy way e.g. “Get a half-price PC in just 5 minutes!”
	Obviously there’s a bit of overlap between these example headings. For instance, it’s likely that they’ll all pique the reader’s curiosity and engage their sense of self-interest.

6. Tell a story. This is not applicable to all type of posts.
	
7. Answer the questions your reader will probably ask
	Anticipate those questions and use the post to provide answers. Consider using those questions as headings.

8. Provide a call to action
	Read a related post? Post a comment? Ask them to do it.

9. Be open and honest

10. Use short sentences for impact

11. Promise an outcome
	  What the reader will learn, laugh at, improve, remember, etc. You don’t have to make an explicit promise, mind you; implicit is fine. E.g. “The funniest video you’ll see all year”.
	
12. Ask questions to which you know the answer will be 'yes'. 
	E.g. We'd all like to earn a little more money, right?

13. Use active language.
	Eg. You'll learn how to ... not, I'll teach you to...
	What the reader will learn, laugh at, improve, remember, etc. You don’t have to make an explicit promise, mind you; implicit is fine. E.g. “The funniest video you’ll see all year”.
	
14. Provide closure.
	Make sure you tie up all loose ends and summarize. E.g. If you’re posting about the merits of jogging at an aerobic pace, the discussion will be fairly complex. Make sure, when you get to the end, that you summarize your argument and how it leads to your conclusion.

15. Be positive.
	Many people will be put off by this: “If you’re tired of being overweight and hate how you look at the beach, try this intense workout routine.” But if you put it like this, it’s much more palatable: “If you want to be slim and look great at the beach, try this dynamic workout routine.”

16. Link with active language
	Use active language, useful detail and key-phrases in the anchor text.
	E.g. Don’t say, “there’s a __great post by John__...”, say, “__read this great post by John__...” Better yet, make it active, informative and search-engine friendly: “__read this great tractor post by John__...”

17. Be rhythmic, but not repetitive
	Partial rhythm is good in blogging. E.g. This is too rhythmic: “Take the new Toyota Corolla, for
	example. It’s quiet, economical and environmentally friendly. It’s
	also stylish, bold and surprisingly spacious. And, of course, it’s
	safe, speedy and technologically advanced.” Three lists of three closely matching descriptors is just too much. Even two would
	have been too many. By mixing it up, we can make it far more engaging: “Take the new Toyota Corolla, for example. It’s quiet, economical and environmentally friendly. Not to mention surprisingly spacious. It’s a bold — yet stylish — speedy car, that’s also safe and technologically advanced.”
	
18. Use emotive language
	E.g. Talk about how they’ll feel when they do something. “You’ll be surprised...” or “You’ll laugh out loud, I promise.” And use emotional descriptors, or descriptors that are closely associated with emotions: “It was a daunting morning...” or “It seemed the day
	got a little brighter...” or “It was the same smell as Grandma’s kitchen...”

19. Use contrast
	Sometimes the most effective way to explain what something is, is to explain what it is not. (Or to combine both.)
	E.g. On a parenting blog: “Parenting isn’t something you do; it’s something you are.” Or on a surfing blog: “Jono made all the other boys in the heat look like long-boarders.”
	
20. Use repetition
	E.g. “This really is a camera to get excited about. A camera to drool over. A camera to save up for.”
	
21. Use metaphors
    Metaphorical language is when we say something is like something else, or that it is something else. I
	E.g. On a body-building blog: “Like you, I’ve been body-building for years, and I’ve seen a lot of big boys. But, I tell you, this guy was a gorilla! Scratch that; he was King Kong!”
	
22. Use incomplete sentences for emphasis
	Sometimes rules just get in the way. For example, a sentence is supposed to express a complete thought, and have a subject (the thing the sentence is about) and a predicate (something about the subject). Usually, complete sentences are hunky-dory, but occasionally, something a little less orthodox is called for. Used appropriately, incomplete (grammatically incorrect) sentences can convey certainty and confidence.
	E.g. “She played her part convincingly. With heart. With soul. With gusto.” The second, third and fourth sentences, here, aren’t grammatically correct, but they do their job beautifully. (i.e., they reinforce the first sentence. There’s absolutely no need to say, “She played her part convincingly. She played it with heart. She played it with soul. She played it with gusto.”

23. Issue a challenge
	When you issue a challenge, you’re making your post interactive, which is exactly what a conversation should be. You’re also invoking the natural competitive spirit. Just as importantly, you’re conveying your confidence, your open-mindedness, your objectivity and your willingness to be proven wrong.
	E.g. “I’m in no way affiliated with Sony, and I can honestly say, these headphones pump out the best bass I’ve ever heard. Try them. And if you’ve heard better, come back and let us all know.”

24. Suggest Further Reading and Give Examples. Provide some suggested links at the end of your post on the topic at hand.
