##	Scan-ability  Guidelines ##
	
1. 	Lead with the important stuff
	
	Make sure visitors who scan can quickly understand what your post is about, and what it offers them. Lead with that information.
	E.g. If your post is about how to cook healthy, delicious meals with whole wheat pasta, you might start as follows:
	Post title:
	Whole wheat pasta: How to make it yummy, not just healthy
	Post body:
	I know whole wheat pasta is healthy. But I never knew it could taste great. Until I met Angelo. He showed me some guarded Italian secrets for making it taste every bit as yummy as the white stuff.
	
2. 	Segment with sub-headings
	
	Use headings frequently as a way of summarizing what would otherwise be long blocks of text.
	In fact, you can use sub-headings every paragraph or two.

3.  Front-load your headings
	
	When readers scan your post, they pay a lot of attention to the first two words in your headings, and not a lot of attention to the rest. So you have to make sure your sentences start with the important meaning words.
	E.g. “German Shepherds: Malicious or misunderstood?” 
	
4. Use lists instead of long sentences
	
	Even if you’re not writing a list post e.g. '10 ways to improve your love life', lists are an excellent way to break up a page, visually, so readers aren’t overwhelmed by big blocks of text. They’re also great for scan-readers, who are likely to glean a great deal of information from a list, but would glean very little if you constrain the same information to a regular paragraph.
	
	E.g. Don’t say this: “There were three main participants in the search engine workshop: small business owners, with zero search experience; marketing managers, looking to expand their search engine experience and make better use of their search budget; and search engine marketing (SEM) managers, looking to update their knowledge with the latest research findings.”
	
	Say this, instead: “There were three main participants in the search engine workshop:
	1. small business owners, with zero search experience;
	2. marketing managers, looking to expand their search engine experience and make better use of their search budget; and
	3. search engine marketing (SEM) managers, looking to update their knowledge with the latest research findings.”

5. Signal when the reader can stop reading
	
	Readers don’t want to read your whole post. If they can glean everything they need without reading right to the end, they will. So signal where the meat of your post ends.
	E.g. For a simple numbered list post, without a trailing discussion, the stop-reading signal is the end of the list. For other posts, a ‘Conclusion’ sub-head is a good idea.
	
6. Use sentence case for headings

	Sentence case is where you capitalize the first letter of only the first word and any proper nouns. Just as you would in a sentence. Title case, on the other hand, is where you capitalize all the words in the heading.
	
	E.g. This is sentence case:
	The German influence is obvious
	These are title case:
	The German Influence is Obvious
	
7. Bold the important bits
	Highlight key meaning elements.
	
8. 	E.g. If you’re debating the merits of a new clinical drug trial, bold the main claim(s) in each paragraph. Then readers will be able to scan the post to see which paragraphs they’d like to read in detail: “For almost two decades, doctors have been advising parents to avoid exposing babies to common allergens (like eggs, peanuts and milk) for as long as possible. The belief was that this would reduce the chance that those children would develop allergies. However, over the past two decades, there has been no corresponding reduction in the number of kids
	with allergies. So allergy experts now agree that **avoiding allergens is not an effective way to minimize the risk of allergy development** in children.”
	
9. Link to related posts & pages

10. Use key-phrases in links

	E.g. If you’re posting about home beer brewing methods for tropical regions, and your primary key-phrase is “home beer brewing”, you could link out to a helpful related site with a link like, “Great home beer brewing recipes for the tropics”. And you could link to a related post on your blog with a link like, “Home beer brewing in sub-tropical climates”.

11. Run the article through a spell and grammar checker.

12. Create one or two useful links to other articles within the blog.
