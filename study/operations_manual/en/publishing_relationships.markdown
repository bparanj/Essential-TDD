## Publishing Articles and Establishing Relationships ##

1. Set up free Google Alerts at www.GoogleAlertsTool.com to email you daily updates on the top companies, personalities, products, or issues important to the people in your target market. 
2. Publish on your blog short summaries of the best articles and blog posts that the Google Alert emails send you each day. Link back to the original articles and give credit. 
3. Demonstrate expertise in your posts and help people in a friendly way on your blog, on your Facebook page, on Twitter, and on Linked In and Google +, as appropriate for your industry. Then ask for comments and feedback to build your brand, traffic, and an audience community. 
4. Reach out personally to 20 top people from your target community. Contact them through email, Facebook, Google +, or relevant community forums to politely invite them to read your new blog, participate by leaving comments and questions, or even submit their own guest posts for you to publish.
