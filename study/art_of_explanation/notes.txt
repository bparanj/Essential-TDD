The Art of Explanations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great explainers have the ability to picture themselves in another person's shoes and communicate from that perspective. It is a process build on empathy, on being able to understand and share the feelings of another. 

The art of explanation is about perspective, orienting yourself around the idea that explanations are creations, made of facts, that represent a new way of approaching an idea. We turn facts into useful, informative, and memorable ideas. It is the art of transforming facts into a more understandable package. 

Explanations:

1. Answer the question 'Why?'
2. Make people care.

Explanations grab attention and makes people see an idea from a personal perspective so they can make informed decisions about learning more. Explanations are packages of ideas that help people feel confident in choosing to learn more because they care about the idea.

Explanations fail due to assumptions, terminology, and direct approach with no context. Good explanations build confidence.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Where are you on the scale regarding a specific idea?
2. Where is your audience ?
3. What assumptions are you making about their level of understanding?
4. Are your current explanations accounting for everyone on the A-Z scale?
5. Should they?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important elements in packaging ideas:

Agreement - Agreement builds confidence from the very first sentence. It is accomplished through big-picture statements that most people will recognize. Example : We can all agree that gas prices are rising.

Context - Context moves the points we have agreed upon into a specific place. It gives the audience a foundation for the explanation and lets them know why it should matter to them. Example: More of your hard earned income is going to pay for transportation.

Story - Story applies the big ideas to a narrative that shows a person who experiences a change in perspective and the emotions that accompany that change. Example: Meet Sally; she's tired of paying so much for gas and needs alternatives. Here's what she found.

Connections - Connections often accompany a story and are analogies to something people already understand. Example: Sally could see that taking the bus was like multitasking because she could work and commute at the same time.

Descriptions - Descriptions are direct communications that are more focused on 'How' vs 'Why'. Sally found that she could save more than $20 a week by taking the bus three times weekly.

Conclusion - Conclusion wraps up the package with a summary of what was learned and provides a next step with a focus on the audience. The next time gas prices get you down, remember...


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Context
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before : Entrepreneur taking an accounting class to learn basics. Teacher using only technical terms to teach accounting. No learning.

After : Teacher talks about business and gradually introduces accounting terms in simple terms relating to running a business. Teacher spent time on the big picture: the world in which accounting operates. This gives the students the context for understanding the technical terms. Why comes first before How.

1. How do you find the right amount of context?
2. How do you estimate the audience's existing knowledge?
3. How do you impress both the experts and the beginners?

Developing a context can be as simple as making a few declarative statements that the audience will find accurate and provable. The idea is to start an explanation by creating a sense of agreement. These statements accomplishes a few valuable goals:

1. They create a baseline for the talk.
2. They give presentation a sense of direction.
3. They give audience confidence that the presentation is about something they understand or have interest.
4. They explain the forest.

At this point, you can explain the opportunities, ideas, and questions in the framework of bigger ideas. You explanation is rooted in ideas upon which everyone has already agreed. 

Context and Pain

Meet Ericka, she has a problem and feels pain
She discovers a solution and tries it
Now she feels happy
Don't you want to feel like Ericka?

An explanation that builds context - how the world impacts and causes pain for someone is compelling. The context then becomes the person's feelings which is powerful.

Context and agreement form the first stepping stone. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Story
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Facts give stories substance. Stories give facts meaning. 

Is this something we can make into a story?
If so, who is this person and what is their need?
What is their experience with this subject?
Will this add to the explanation?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Connections
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Focus on ideas people already know and build on them. You know X, right? Well Y is like it, and here's why...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Descriptions are a valid and normal part of explanations. They are best used toward the Z end of the scale, where the priority is likely to be more focused on how than on why.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simplification
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The curse of knowledge causes explanations to be:

Accurate, yet incomprehensible
Detailed to the point of being ineffective
Filled with unfamiliar words
Presented without context or application

When we consider simplification, we focus on transforming the complex details into big, understandable ideas that serve as stepping-stones to future understanding.

You can simplify complex idea by following a few guidelines:

Do not make assumptions about what people already know.
  Gauge the audience's level of understanding and list the pertinent subject they are likely to understand.
Use the most basic language possible.
  Consider your normal language and list words that would not sound familiar to your audience.
Zoom out and try to see the subject from the broadest perspective possible.
  Write down statements that reflect the basic ideas of your topic.
Forget the details and exceptions and focus on big ideas.
Trade accuracy for understanding.
Connect the basic ideas to ideas the audience already understands.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Constraints help us feel confident and capable of making the right choices. Before starting the decision making process, define and limit your options to a couple of variables. This will narrow down the selection to a manageable number. Constraints bring focus and attention to things that may have been overlooked.

Project duration - It must be complete by a certain date.
Video duration - The video must be less than 2 minutes long.
Ideas - Only few ideas can be explained in 2 minutes.
Format - We can only do what is possible in Click Plan style.
Language - We must present it in the vernacular of a specific audience
Music - No music used in the videos.

By agreeing on a set of constraints, we can start to evaluate ideas from the context of what is possible within them. If a video must be under 3 minutes, you can only say so much within 3 minutes. Project deadline force you to keep the project moving. 

We intentionally create a container that allows us to evaluate what's in or out quickly, which frees up our attention to focus on essential things. When all data and ideas are on the table, there is endless potential, and we could spend weeks working through it in an effort to explain it all. Constraints help us eliminate most of that data and focus on connecting what will fit within out constraints.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints and Explanations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you are overwhelmed with ton of ideas, you can use constraints. 

Timeline - When do you need to have the explanation ready?
Duration - How long should it take to explain?
Location - Where will the explanation be presented?
Format - How will the information be presented?
Idea Volume - How many ideas can you explain in the defined duration?
Language - How technical is the language that the target audience speaks?

Example: The explanation needs to be ready in four weeks, should take 2 minutes to explain, covers two ideas, is presented using keynote and scanner. It will be written in the language of a self publisher.

For brainstorming and organizing ideas use sticky notes, each contain one idea. You can think about all the themes and ideas that could be a part of explanation and then put them all up on a wall.

Next organize them into groups and start filtering them by removing the ones that don't fit with the big idea groups that emerge. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparing and Writing an Explanation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We work through ideas and create a vision for every explanation. This script can evolve before being presented. The images on the whiteboard are simply visual aids for a carefully crafted script.

1. Big idea - We are going to make a video about X.
2. Research and discover - What main points do we need to make?
3. Script writing - How will we make it easy to understand?

Define and document the problem you want to solve and review how the ideas can be communicated with a story that answers 'why'. Now you can begin to write a first version of the script. One minute of video time is about 150 words. 

Elements of a basic script:

1. Agreement
2. Context - problem / pain and vision of solution
3. Story
4. Connection
5. Description
6. Realization of solution - how
7. Call to action

Agreement
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are noncontroversial statements that start to frame the explanation's direction. You could start each statement with 'We can all agree ...'. By making these statements, we give the audience easily understood information.

Context
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reveal why an idea makes sense. State in clear terms a real problem that everyone understands. 
Next present a vision for the future. These are often 'what if' statements that inspire the audience to imagine a world in which this problem has been solved.

The explanation has been very general up to this point. Ideas and language have built confidence and context. Now is the time for - what will solve this problem and achieve this vision of the future? You can use the following elements to do so :

1. Story - Introduce a character and outline some basic facts about this character. This character is similar to the audience. He lives in the world we introduced earlier and feels the pain. This character then discovers a new way to do things (the big idea). The character tries it, it feels better and it makes sense (how it works). The character feels satisfied because life has changed for the better. Ex: Samuel was losing sleep because his new product was off-schedule, but now that he's using XYZ product, he's able to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

2. Connection - Take an indirect approach to addressing the big idea. Talk about something like it in the form of, 'You know X works, right? Well, Y is a lot like it in these ways'. These connections help the audience see the big idea without getting bogged down in details. The connection is about understanding the concept. Ex: Sam started to see that XYZ was kind of like an assembly line for fixing his product. Each step was automated and kept the process moving.

3. Description - Sometimes explanations take the form of tactical introductions about how to accomplish a specific task. This is appropriate when the audience is at the Z end.

Realization
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that we've shown the idea at work and given the audience a new perspective, we can show them the outcome: How the idea will change lives or actually works. Ex: Now Sam is getting all the sleep he needs because he knows XYZ is there to keep the project on track.

Call to Action
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wrap up the explanation with an invitation to take an action. It could invite to learn more, contact someone, complete a form, signup for a class, try a product. This marks the end of the explanation. Ex: To learn more about how XYZ can help your company stay on track, go to this website.

The secret to crafting a great explanation is not necessarily using the right formula, it's learning to recognize when people can't grasp an idea and developing a script that solves the problem.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Present
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. State Your Intentions Early.

	Context is an important part of creating an explanation. The title gives us the first chance to build context. Video titles are the topic we are explaining. This prepares the audience for the presentation and sets expectations. The title becomes a way to show that the video's intention is to accomplish a specific goal.
	
2. Solve a Problem

	If you create an explanation that solves a problem and helps them feel confident about an idea, it will make an impression and create demand for more.
	
3. Keep It Short

	Keep videos under 3 minutes long and include only few ideas. Use the 3 minutes to move someone from disinterest to interest, which can develop into much more.
	
4. Reduce Noise

	Reduce visual noise. Everything that appears on the whiteboard should have a purpose. This creates a clean, uncluttered experience for the viewer that feels accessible and simple.
	
5. Use Visuals

	Using visuals effectively makes explanations remarkable and memorable. Use simple visuals. By eliminating faces we can invite people to see themselves in the characters used in the videos. You can scan hand drawn pictures using scanner, crap and insert into the presentation.
	
6. Embrace Imperfection

	Hand drawn characters. Handwritten note style. Within the first few seconds, videos show that you are more concerned about substance and understanding than polished design and perfection. And that matters.
	
7. Slow Down

	Pause between sentences. Have transitions between visuals. Have a consistent low intensity pace.
	
8. Be Timeless

	Explanations must be valuable today and years into the future. Focus on big ideas and themes.
	
9. Have Fun

	Aim for gentle humor and informality.
