1. Login to Linode account. Select Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 32 bit image.
2. Root password, generated using encrypt_decrypt.rb for domain clickplan.net. The secret key is the zepho business mail password.
3. Login to Linode account and reset the root password generated in step 1.
4. Boot the linode to bring it up.
5. Verify the password is set to the expected password by logging into server via SSH:
	 ssh root@192.155.83.63
6. Create a new deploy user called rails: $ adduser rails
   The password for rails user is generated by encrypt_decrypt.rb for clickplan.net, deploy option.
7. Give rails user sudo permissions with no password prompt during deploy. 
	 $ visudo 
	   rails ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
	 Control + X to save and exit.
8. cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   If the SSH key is not there then run: $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
9. Install Homebrew
   ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
10. brew install ssh-copy-id
11. ssh-copy-id rails@192.155.83.63
12. Verify the copied SSH keys.
    "ssh 'rails@192.155.83.63'", and check:

     cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

     to make sure we haven't added extra keys that you weren't expecting.
13. On your local machine, open ~/.ssh/config file with any text editor and add your information using the template below:

Host clickplan
  Hostname 192.155.83.63
  User rails
14. Save & close that file. Now you should be able to connect to your server by just typing:
    ssh clickplan
    If that doesn't work: ssh rails@clickplan.net
15. $ ssh clickplan
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
		Leave password fields empty.
		$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
		Copy the public key to Github account SSH keys.
16. 

To delete user rails, login as root and run:
deluser rails
