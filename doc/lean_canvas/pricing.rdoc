Pricing 

1. Create a testable hypothesis, time-box the experiment, and validate qualitatively, then verify quantitatively. 
2. Start with a single “Free Trial” pricing plan.
3. Time-based trials help time-box your pricing experiments so you can force a conversion decision which allows you to learn and iterate faster.
4. Pick a price to test
5. Existing alternatives create “reference points” in the minds of customers that they will use to rank your solution, so understand and position your price against them.
6. Ensure the lifetime value of your customers exceeds the cost of customer acquisition by at least a factor of three.
