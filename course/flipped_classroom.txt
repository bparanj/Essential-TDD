Students watch lecture at home at their own pace, communicating with peers and teachers via online discussions
Concept engagement takes place in the classroom with the help of the instructor

Learning through activity
Reserve class time for collaborative work and concept mastery exercises

Teachers created three videos a week
Students watched the 5 to 7 minute videos at home 
Class time was spent doing labs or interactive activities to illustrate concepts

After students watch lessons, they write down any questions. Teachers review those questions with students individually. 
Teachers have more time to help students and explain difficulty concepts
