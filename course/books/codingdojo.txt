Skills Required to do TDD

My Customization :

Designing Test Cases
Designing Clean Code
Driving Design with Tests
Refactoring

My Insights:

TDD is not a series of moves from one state to another
TDD is shift in focus from problem domain to solution domain. It depends on the state.
Toy code? A code kata helps you focus on practicing a specific skill.
