How to Start

1. Outline on the board (with check boxes)
2. Start with a promise. Say something to the audience that indicates to them how they will be empowered by the talk, how they will be better people by the time I am finished.

The Big Four

1. Cycle (say 3 times)
2. Verbal punctuation (keeping track of where you are)
3. Near miss (2 or more)

Surrounding the concept with near miss that help to establish it's boundaries and provides an effective way to zero-in on just what the concept is about.

4. Ask question (frequent easy questions). Pause for 5 seconds for the answer.

Time and Place

Style
Development of your style. Elements of style to bring into your persona. Look at every body with view towards finding points of style that I can adapt to my own skills, my own body and adapt. 
It's ok to eccentric (that is entertaining and useful as handles). 
Use stories.

How to Stop
