The 6 W's

1. Who and What - Things, people and roles

	What is going on around me, and where do I fit in?
	Who is in charge and who else is involved? Where does responsibility lie?
	
2. How much - Measuring and counting
	
	Do we have enough of X to last as long as we need?
	How much of X do we need to keep going? If we increase this over here, can we decrease that over there?
	
3. When - Scheduling and timing

	What comes first, and what comes next?
	We've got a lot of things to do: When are we going to do them all?
	
4. Where - Direction and how things fit together

	Where are we going now? Are we headed in the right direction, or should we be moving elsewhere?
	How do all these pieces fit together? What's most important and what matters less?
	
5. How - How things influence one another.

	What will happen if we do this? What about that?
	Can we alter the outcomes of a situation by altering our actions?
	
6. Why - Seeing the big picture

	What are we really doing and why? Is it the right thing, or should we be doing something different?
	If we need to change, what are our options? How can we decide which of those options are best?
	
Visual thinking is about how comfortable we are in thinking with our eyes.

The Visual Thinking Process

Looking

Process of taking in the visual information around us. It's about collecting inputs and making initial rough assessments of what's out there, so that we know how to respond. It involves scanning the environment in order to build an initial big picture.

Questions

- What is there? Is there a lot of it? What is not there?
- How far am I able to look? What are the edges and limits of my vision in this situation?
- What do I recognize right away, and what throws me off?
- Are the things in front of me what I expected to see? Can I get them rapidly or do I need to spend extra time figuring out what I'm looking at?

	
Activities

- Scan across the whole landscape. Build a big picture, note that there are forests and trees... and leaves, as well.
- Find the edges and determine which way is up. Establish the limits of our view and the fundamental coordinates of the data in front of us.
- Make an initial pass at screening out the noise, separate the visual wheat from the chaff.

Seeing

We are selecting which inputs are worth more detailed inspection. This is based on recognizing patterns. 

Questions

- Do I know what I'm seeing? Have I seen this before?
- Are any patterns emerging? Does anything in particular stand out?
- What can I take away from what I see - what patters, what priorities, what interactions - to help me make enough sense of this environment in order to make decisions about it?
- Do I have enough visual inputs collected to make sense of what I see, or do I need to go back and keep looking?

Activities

- Filter for relevance: Actively select those visual inputs worth another look and dismiss others. Then later go back and check again.
- Categorize and make distinctions: Separate the wheat into different categories by type.
- Notice patterns and clump creatively; identify visual commonalities among inputs and larger commonalities among categories.

Imagining

It is either the act of seeing with our eyes closed or the act of seeing something that isn't there.

Questions

- Where have I seen this before? Can I make any analogies to things I've seen in the past?
- Are there better ways to configure the patterns I see? Can I rearrange them to make more sense?
- Can I manipulate the patterns so that something invisible becomes visible?
- Is there a hidden framework connecting everything I saw? Can I use that framework as a place to put other things that I've seen?

Activities

- Close your eyes to see more: With all visual inputs fresh in the mind, look with your eyes closed and see if new connections emerge.
- Find analogies: Ask, 'Where have I seen this before?' and then imagine how analogous solutions might work in this new situation.
- Manipulate the patterns: Turn pictures upside down, flop them left to right, switch coordinates to turn them inside out. See if something new becomes visible.
- Alter the obvious: Push visual ideas by finding multiple ways to show the same thing.

Showing

We summarize what we've seen. Find the best framework for visually representing our ideas, nail things down on paper, point out what we imagined and then answer our audience's questions.

Questions

- Of all I've imagined, what are the three most important pictures that emerged - both for me and for my audience?
- What is the best way to visually convey my idea? Which visual framework will be most appropriate for sharing what I've seen?
- When I go back to what I originally looked at, does what I'm now showing still make sense?
- Say, 'This is what I saw.' Then ask your audience, 'Does it make sense to you? Do you see the same things, or do you see something different?

Activities

- Clarify your best ideas: Prioritize all visual ideas so that the most relevant come to the top.
- Nail things down: Pick the appropriate visual framework and get your ideas down on paper or up on the board.
- Cover all the W's: Make sure that who/what, how much, where and when are always visible; let how and why emerge as the visual punch line.

Four Rules to Develop Looking Skill

1. Collect everything we can to look at - the more the better (at least at first)
2. Have a place where we can lay out everything and really look at it all, side by side
	Everything looks different when we can see it all at once
3. Always define a basic coordinate system to give us clear orientation and position
4. Find ways to cut ruthlessly from everything our eyes bring in - we need to practice visual triage
