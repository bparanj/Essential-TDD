Iterative Development
------------------------

Publish Now. Polish Later.
Keep it Simple. Get it Done.

Develop the first version of all the materials. Then go back and upgrade all of the materials to the second level. Test the market for the course content before spending time on creating a full course. This development model lets you release a small version of the course. 


Existing Resources
------------------------

Pull all of content you created into a single folder. Put other reference material also into the same folder. With the course outline in hand, review your existing materials. Note on your course outline which of these materials you could use for each topic.
