Negative Factors
-----------------

Digressions, Noisy chatter
Developing Framework is hard to follow and confusing.
Unknown language distracts from the TDD lessons
Sophisticated techniques not covered
Failed Humor
None of the sample projects are really complicated enough to do more than get us going on the path of TDD.
Lack of a complete, working summary of the code developed in the examples (final, authoritative version)
The only issues I ran in to was using the newer 3rd party Frameworks that the book talks about. This is only due to version differences and changes since the book was written.


Where to go next
-----------------

Read more. Design Patterns. Refactoring.
Take courses
Work with an experienced TDD practitioner to apply TDD to real world projects
