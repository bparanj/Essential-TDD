Editing 
-------

1. Change the resolution of the Canvas to 1280x720.
2. Click the video, drag the screen to where you want the video to start and play through until you need to do:
   a) Cut out the video. To delete parts of the video you're basically going to split the clip in two places, delete the video in between the cuts, and drag the other clips together. To do a split you can select the edit menu and then the "Split Clip" item or better yet, just do Shift + Command + T. Find where you want to cut the clip to, split it there, select (click) the video in between the cuts, hit the delete key, and then drag one part of the video up against the other. You can undo if you cut too much.
